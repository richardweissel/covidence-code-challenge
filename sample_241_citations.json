Methods: Respondents of the longitudinal Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 11 European countries were selected when (i) aged between 50 years and the country-specific retirement age, (ii) in paid employment at baseline, and (iii) having information on employment status during the 4-year follow-up period (N = 4923). Self-perceived health, health behaviors, and physical and psychosocial work characteristics were measured by interview at baseline. Employment status was derived from follow-up interviews after two and four years. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify determinants of unemployment, disability pension, and early retirement. Results: Poor health was a risk factor for disability pension [hazard ratio (HR) 3.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.51–6.05], and a lack of physical activity was a risk factor for disability pension (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.68–5.55) and unemployment (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.13–3.01). A lack of job control was a risk factor for disability pension, unemployment, and early retirement (HR 1.30–1.77). Conclusions: Poor health, a lack of physical activity, and a lack of job control played a role in exit from paid employment, but their relative importance differed by pathway of labor force exit. Primary preventive interventions focusing on promoting physical activity as well as increasing job control may contribute to reducing premature exit from paid employment.

The objective of this Cochrane systematic review is to investigate clinical outcomes between pharmacist interventions in community pharmacy-associated ambulatory care clinics versus institution-associated ambulatory care clinics. The overall aim will be to determine if pharmacist interventions differ between these types of clinics and whether that has an impact on patient outcomes. The study plans to address the comparative effectiveness of community pharmacy-associated clinics as this service continues to expand. The study will also attempt to correlate any outcomes with different factors present within each clinic. The study expects to find no differences between the respective ambulatory care clinics. Methods: The University of California, San Francisco, Institutional Review Board has approved this study. Study articles were selected after searching through a comprehensive Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group internal register, and Medline search. Inclusion criteria requires studies to be randomized controlled trials, have pharmacist-delivered cognitive interventions in the outpatient setting, and objectively collected outcome measures. Data abstraction and inclusion determination will be performed by two independent reviewers. Outcome variables will include blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid panel, anticoagulation management, hospitalizations, morbidity and mortality, processrelated outcomes (number of prescriptions, changes in therapy, discontinuation of therapies), and other objectively measured outcomes if due to pharmacist intervention. All data collection and analysis will be completed using Cochrane's Review Manager 5.

Because angiotensin (Ang) II significantly decreased local HGF production, we performed (1) in vitro experiments using fibroblasts and (2) administration of an ACE inhibitor (temocapril) and an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (CS-866) to cardiomyopathic hamsters. Methods and Results - In human fibroblasts, HGF significantly increased the production of matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) and urokinase plasminogen activator, whereas HGF also significantly attenuated the reduction of MMP-1 activity induced by Ang II. In contrast, HGF significantly decreased transforming growth factor (TGF)-β mRNA stimulated by Ang II, whereas HGF also decreased basal TGF-β protein level without affecting growth. Similarly, in rat cardiac fibroblasts, HGF inhibited the expression and production of TGF-β, whereas HGF upregulated its specific receptor, c-met. Conversely, in vivo experiments revealed that administration of temocapril and CS-866 to cardiomyopathic hamsters resulted in a significant decrease in fibrotic area and increase in cardiac HGF concentration and mRNA (P<0.01), whereas cardiac concentration and mRNA of HGF were significantly decreased in cardiomyopathic hamsters. In contrast, mRNA expression of collagen III was markedly decreased by treatment with temocapril and CS-866. Conclusions - Here, we demonstrated that Ang II blockade prevented myocardial fibrosis in the cardiomyopathic hamster, accompanied by a significant increase in cardiac HGF. Overall, increase in local HGF expression may participate in the prevention of myocardial injury by Ang II blockade through its antifibrotic action.","published_year":2000,"pages":"246-252","journal":"Circulation"},

Individuals with impaired swallowing, however, may be unable to do so, instead requiring two or more swallows; this phenomenon is called \"piecemeal deglutition\". The term \"dysphagia limit\" refers to the volume at which piecemeal deglutition occurs. The aim of our study was to investigate the potential value of scintigraphic evaluation of piecemeal deglutition and dysphagia limit in patients with dysphagia, based on correlation with the results of submental electromyography (SM-EMG) and laryngeal sensor monitoring (LS). The study population comprised 24 patients with dysphagia secondary to neurological disorders and ten normal adults, who formed a control group. In the scintigraphic evaluation, subjects underwent four separate dynamic studies using 5, 10, 15 and 20 ml of water containing 0.5 mCi technetium-99m labelled sulphur colloid, and time-activity curves (TACs) were created for each study. Static thoracic images were also recorded in order to detect airway aspiration Observation of two or more peaks on TACs within the 10-s acquisition period was considered a sign of piecemeal deglutition. If piecemeal deglutition occurred at or below 20 ml, this volume was regarded as the dysphagia limit. Piecemeal deglutition was not found in any normal subjects; by contrast, it was observed in 14 of the 24 (58%) patients on scintigraphy and in 17 (71%) patients on EMG and LS. In three patients, signs of the airway aspiration were observed on static thoracic images. Scintigraphic and electrophysiological findings were in agreement in 19 patients (79%), and the correlation between scintigraphy and the electrophysiological methods for the evaluation of dysphagia was statistically significant (r=0.57, P=0.003). The novel finding of this study is the demonstration of piecemeal deglutition and dysphagia limit on scintigraphic studies in patients with neurogenic dysphagia. Based on this finding we consider that scintigraphic evaluations of piecemeal deglutition and dysphagia limit could be of value especially in centres which do not have electrophysiological test facilities. The technique should be added to the list of standard scintigraphic methods for the evaluation of patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia.","published_year":2004,"pages":"94-8","journal":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging"},

B.","Rowel, R. H.","Sydnor, K. L.","Divers, S. P."],"abstract":"Calcium and dairy consumption are documented to be low among African Americans and have demonstrated benefits to bone growth, overall nutritional status, and health throughout the life cycle. There is also an emerging relationship to the prevention of obesity. This low consumption has been attributed to both cultural and community/environmental barriers. Using a life course construct and an ecological model of health behavior, this paper will illustrate why nutrition education and food consumption behavior at one stage of the life cycle may influence health status at that stage as well as influence health and consumption of calcium and dairy products at subsequent stages. The life course construct recognizes that both past and present behavior and experiences (in this case food and nutrient intake) are shaped by the wider social, economic, and cultural context and therefore may provide clues to current patterns of health and disease. The ecological model, concerned with constructs of environmental change, behavior, and policies that may help people make choices in their daily life, complements the life course approach when examining the potential influence of nutrition education provided by federally funded food and nutrition programs on calcium and dairy consumption behavior across the life cycle. The \"critical period model\" within the life course construct is operative for calcium, a nutrient for which adequate intake is critically important during adolescence when peak bone density development, necessary for later protection against osteoporosis, is important.","published_year":2006,"pages":"1103-6","journal":"Journal of Nutrition"},

Averting a pandemic of H5N1 influenza virus depends on the successful control of its endemicity, outbreaks in poultry and occasional spillage into human which carries a case-fatality rate of over 50%. The use of perimetric depopulation and vaccination has failed to halt the spread of the epidemic. Blanket vaccination for all poultry over a large geographical area is difficult. A combination of moratorium, segregation of water fowls from chickens and vaccination have been proved to be effective in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) since 2002 despite endemicity and outbreaks in neighbouring regions. Systematic surveillance in southern China showed that ducks and geese are the primary reservoirs which transmit the virus to chickens, minor poultry and even migratory birds. Presentation of the hypothesis: We hypothesize that this combination of moratorium, poultry segregation and targeted vaccination if successfully adapted to an affected district or province in any geographical region with high endemicity would set an example for the control in other regions. Testing the hypothesis: A planned one-off moratorium of 3 weeks at the hottest month of the year should decrease the environmental burden as a source of re-infection. Backyard farms will then be re-populated by hatchlings from virus-free chickens and minor poultry only. Targeted immunization of the ducks and geese present only in the industrial farms and also the chickens would be strictly implemented as blanket immunization of all backyard poultry is almost impossible. Freely grazing ducks and geese would not be allowed until neutralizing antibodies of H5 subtype virus is achieved. As a proof of concept, a simple mathematical model with susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) structure of coupled epidemics between aquatic birds (mainly ducks and geese) and chickens was used to estimate transmissibility within and between these two poultry populations. In the field the hypothesis is tested by prospective surveillance of poultry and immunocompetent patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia for the virus before and after the institution of these measures. Implications of the Hypothesis: A combination of targeted immunization with the correct vaccine, segregation of poultry species and moratorium of poultry in addition to the present surveillance, biosecurity and hygienic measures at the farm, market and personal levels could be important in the successful control of the H5N1 virus in poultry and human for an extensive geographical region with continuing outbreaks. Alternatively a lesser scale of intervention at the district level can be considered if there is virus detection without evidence of excess poultry deaths since asymptomatic shedding is common in waterfowls. © 2007 Guan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","published_year":2007,"pages":null,"journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases"},
 {"title":"Home-based educational interventions for children with asthma","authors":["Welsh,E. J.","Hasan,M.","Li,P."],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: While guidelines recommend that children with asthma should receive asthma education, it is not known if education delivered in the home is superior to usual care or the same education delivered elsewhere. The home setting allows educators to reach populations (such as the economically disadvantaged) that may experience barriers to care (such as lack of transportation) within a familiar environment. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review on educational interventions for asthma delivered in the home to children, caregivers or both, and to determine the effects of such interventions on asthma-related health outcomes. We also planned to make the education interventions accessible to readers by summarising the content and components. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which includes the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also searched the Education Resources Information Center database (ERIC), reference lists of trials and review articles (last search January 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of asthma education delivered in the home to children, their caregivers or both. In the first comparison, eligible control groups were provided usual care or the same education delivered outside of the home. For the second comparison, control groups received a less intensive educational intervention delivered in the home. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected the trials, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled dichotomous data with fixed-effect odds ratio and continuous data with mean difference (MD) using a fixed-effect where possible. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 12 studies involving 2342 children were included. Eleven out of 12 trials were conducted in North America, within urban or suburban settings involving vulnerable populations. The studies were overall of good methodological quality. They differed markedly in terms of age, severity of asthma, context and content of the educational intervention leading to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Due to this clinical heterogeneity, we did not pool results for our primary outcome, the number of patients with exacerbations requiring emergency department (ED) visit. The mean number of exacerbations requiring ED visits per person at six months was not significantly different between the home-based intervention and control groups (N = 2 studies; MD 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to 0.27). Only one trial contributed to our other primary outcome, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids. Hospital admissions also demonstrated wide variation between trials with significant changes in some trials in both directions. Quality of life improved in both education and control groups over time.A table summarising some of the key components of the education programmes is included in the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found inconsistent evidence for home-based asthma educational interventions compared to standard care, education delivered outside of the home or a less intensive educational intervention delivered at home. Although education remains a key component of managing asthma in children, advocated in numerous guidelines, this review does not contribute further information on the fundamental content and optimum setting for such educational interventions.","published_year":2011,"pages":"CD008469","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"},

Few previous studies have focused on the fate of CO contralateral to the side of a prior carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The aim of this study was to analyze the mortality rate and the incidence of cerebrovascular events in the hemisphere ipsilateral to CO (HICO) in patients who had undergone contralateral CEA. The 30-day and long-term outcomes of 153 consecutive patients who had CEA for severe symptomatic and asymptomatic ICA lesions contralateral to a symptomatic or asymptomatic CO over a 15-year period were considered. The endpoints of the study were mortality and neurological events in the HICO. Overall, the 30-day mortality and stroke rates were 0.6% (1/153) and 1.9% (3/153), respectively; the only death was stroke-related and the stroke was ipsilateral to the operated side. The other 2 strokes were ipsilateral to a symptomatic CO. The follow-up was completed for all patients (mean, 7.7 years; range, 1-172 months). Overall, there were 4 late strokes (2.6%), one of them lacunar in a patient with a symptomatic CO, whereas the other 3 were atheroembolic and ipsilateral to the operated ICA. The risk of late stroke in the HICO at 5 and 12 years was 2%. Overall, there were 19 late deaths, none of them stroke-related. CO, with or without symptoms, contralateral to CEA could be considered a locally benign condition in the long term.","published_year":2007,"pages":"206-11","journal":"Vasc Endovascular Surg"},

Further aims were to investigate whether a stereotype of stutterers was found among these speech-language pathologists, and to determine whether there was any relationship between the attitudes held about stutterers, and the therapists' training and experience. A random probability sample of respondents was selected from the population of speech therapists registered with the Interim Medical and Dental Council of South Africa (I.M.D.C.S.A.). A self-administered mailed questionnaire was employed to realise the aims of the study. The main result of this investigation indicated that almost 50% of the sample of qualified clinicians surveyed, viewed stutterers as a group characterised by specific personality traits and psychological problems. This belief held true irrespective of the number of years of experience working in the field, the time of graduation, the frequency of treating stutterers, or the training emphasis. Implications of these results are considered with respect to student training, continuing education of qualified practitioners and future research.","published_year":1997,"pages":"13-23","journal":"The South African journal of communication disorders"},

This study characterized treated teens' short-term alcohol and other drug use trajectories over 1-year follow-up. Adolescents (N = 110, ages 12-18, 65% male, 94% white) recruited from addictions treatment, with a current DSM-IV alcohol diagnosis, reported on daily alcohol and other drug use in monthly telephone contacts over 1-year follow-up using the Timeline Follow-Back procedure. Latent class mixture modeling identified trajectories based on maximum number of consecutive abstinent days per month, separately for alcohol and other drugs. Four alcohol trajectories were identified: high abstinence (53%), decreasing abstinence (10%), increasing abstinence (16%) and low abstinence (21%). The alcohol trajectories were distinguished by gender, age, readiness to change substance use and alcohol-related coping. To characterize changes in alcohol abstinence in relation to abstinence from other drugs, four other drug trajectories were identified: high (59%), decreasing (12%), increasing (14%) and low (15%) abstinence. Cross-classification of the alcohol and drug trajectories indicated a moderate level of concordance (kappa = 0.49). Multiple pathways of short-term change in alcohol and other drug use were identified. Although changes in abstinence from alcohol and other drug use tended to co-occur, exceptions were observed. Differences between alcohol trajectories in readiness to change substance use and use of substance coping suggest the potentially positive impact of targeted and effectively timed interventions that focus on motivational enhancement and on improving substance coping for certain adolescent subgroups.","published_year":2004,"pages":"105-14","journal":"Journal of studies on alcohol"},

The aim of the study was to estimate outpatient and inpatient care costs in provincial general hospitals. METHODS: We were using top down cost estimation method. Total eight provincial hospitals participated in the study. RESULTS: Generally, 51 percent of the total costs was spent for inpatient medical care, 11 percent was spent on outpatient care, 5 percent was spent on emergency care, 18 percent was spent for additional services and 18 percent were for management costs. In Umnugobi provincial general hospital there were 455 outpatients per employee, whereas 200 outpatients per employee were in Dornod provincial general hospital. There were 34 and 17 inpatients per employee at Khovd provincial general hospital and Tov provincial general hospital respectively whereas the average was 27. Day surgery costs were the highest, 248.583 MNT, and the lowest costs were for eye outpatient, 7270 MNT.

We present the case of a 54-yr-old man with vanishing lung syndrome, an idiopathic form of severe bullous emphysema, who has made repeated trips to altitudes as high as 3400 m, where he has engaged in physical activity, such as downhill skiing. We consider the issues of adequacy of oxygenation and the risks of barotrauma in patients with obstructive lung disease traveling to high altitude, and we also consider factors, such as improved air-flow limitation, maintenance of adequate ventilation-perfusion matching, and underlying physical fitness, which may affect our patient's ability to tolerate physical activity in this environment. The case demonstrates that the presence of severe lung disease does not necessarily preclude travel to and moderate activity at high altitude. Such travel may, in fact, be safe as long as the patient has undergone appropriate pretravel evaluation, and we provide recommendations regarding such evaluation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","published_year":2007,"pages":"1891-5","journal":"Medicine and science in sports and exercise"},

R.","Haghighi, M. M."],"abstract":"Obesity and its metabolic consequences are major risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, lifestyle interventions, including exercise training and dietary components may decrease cardiovascular risk. Hence, this study was conducted to assess the effects of ginger supplementation and progressive resistance training on some cardiovascular risk factors in obese men. In a randomized double-blind design, 32 obese Iranian men (BMI >/= 30) were assigned in to one of four groups: Placebo (PL, n = 8); ginger group (GI, n = 8) that consumed 1 gr ginger/d for 10 wk; resistance training plus placebo (RTPL, n = 8); and 1gr ginger plus resistance exercise (RTGI, n = 8). Progressive resistance training was performed three days per week for 10 weeks and included eight exercises. At baseline and after 10 weeks, body composition and anthropometric indices were measured. To identify other risk factors, venous blood samples were obtained before and 48-72 hours after the last training session for measurement of blood lipids (LDL-C, HDL-C, TG), systemic inflammation (CRP), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). After 10 weeks both RTGI and RTPL groups showed significant decreases in waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percent, body fat mass, total cholesterol, and insulin resistance (p < 0.05) and a significant increase in fat free mass (FFM) (p < 0.05), while it remained unchanged in PL and GI. Further, significant decreases in the mean values of CRP were observed in all groups except PL (p < 0.05). Our results reveal that resistance training is an effective therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk in obese Iranian men. Further, ginger supplementation alone or in combination with resistance training, also reduces chronic inflammation. However more research on the efficacy of this supplement to reduce cardiovascular risk in humans is required. Key pointsLong- term resistance training reduced cardiovascular risk factors in obese men.Ginger supplementation can also decrease chronic low grade inflammation in obese men.More researches are warranted to elicit the effects of these interventions on cardiovascular risk factors in humans.","published_year":2011,"pages":"685-91","journal":"J Sports Sci Med"},

 {"title":"Screening of the spine in adolescents: inter- and intra-rater reliability and measurement error of commonly used clinical tests","authors":["Aartun, E.","Degerfalk, A.","Kentsdotter, L.","Hestbaek, L."],"abstract":"Background: Evidence on the reliability of clinical tests used for the spinal screening of children and adolescents is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the inter-and intra-rater reliability and measurement error of clinical tests commonly used when screening young spines. Methods: Two experienced chiropractors independently assessed 111 adolescents aged 12-14 years who were recruited from a primary school in Denmark. A standardised examination protocol was used to test inter-rater reliability including tests for scoliosis, hypermobility, general mobility, inter-segmental mobility and end range pain in the spine. Seventy-five of the 111 subjects were re-examined after one to four hours to test intra-rater reliability. Percentage agreement and Cohen's Kappa were calculated for binary variables, and interclass correlation (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots with Limits of Agreement (LoA) were calculated for continuous measures. Results: Inter-rater percentage agreement for binary data ranged from 59.5% to 100%. Kappa ranged from 0.06-1.00. Kappa >= 0.40 was seen for elbow, thumb, fifth finger and trunk/hip flexion hypermobility, pain response in inter-segmental mobility and end range pain in lumbar flexion and extension. For continuous data, ICCs ranged from 0.40-0.95. Only forward flexion as measured by finger-to-floor distance reached an acceptable ICC(>= 0.75). Overall, results for intra-rater reliability were better than for inter-rater reliability but for both components, the LoA were quite wide compared with the range of assessments. Conclusion: Some clinical tests showed good, and some tests poor, reliability when applied in a spinal screening of adolescents. The results could probably be improved by additional training and further test standardization. This is the first step in evaluating the value of these tests for the spinal screening of adolescents. Future research should determine the association between these tests and current and/or future neck and back pain.","published_year":2014,"pages":"","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders"},
 {"title":"Devalued, deskilled and diversified: explaining the proliferation of the strip industry in the UK","authors":["Sanders, T.","Hardy, K."],"abstract":"This paper looks beyond the debates that focus on the objectification of the female body to examine the question as to why strip clubs have proliferated and found a permanent place in the night-time economy in the UK. Using empirical qualitative and quantitative data from the largest study into the strip industry in the UK to date, we challenge the common assumption that 'demand' is responsible for the rise in erotic dance. Instead, we argue that the proliferation of strip clubs is largely due to the internal economic structures of the industry which have developed partly in response to the financial crisis beginning in 2008. First, we argue that clubs profit from individual dancers through an exploitative system of fees and fines, rendering a strip club business a low cost investment with high returns and little risk to club owners. Second, we note that the last decade has seen diversification of the industry accompanied by deskilling and devaluing of dancing and dancers' labour. Third, we demonstrate that despite the negative effects of these changes on workers, there has been an expansion of the industry as the ability to make profit, even during a financial crisis was ensured through the transferral of risk to workers. Overall, we suggest that far from proliferating as a response to demand, the industry has maintained its market presence due to its ability to establish highly financially exploitation employment relationships with dancers at a time of economic fragility.","published_year":2012,"pages":"513-32","journal":"Br J Sociol"},

Design: We enrolled patients admitted for induction of labour with oxytocin. Exclusion criteria for induction of labour included non-vertex presentation, past history of more than one caesarean delivery, multiple pregnancies, non-reassuring fetal heart rate before induction of labour and estimated fetal weight of more than 4250 g. Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ha'Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel. Population: Patients who were admitted for induction of labour in Ha'Emek Medical Center from 1st February 1998 to 29th February 2000. Methods: Patients were randomly divided into two groups. In group A, infusion of oxytocin was incremental until 5 cm dilation and maintained at the same level from that point throughout the labour. In group B, infusion of oxytocin was incremental but was discontinued when cervical dilatation reached 5 cm. Comparison between the two groups was made using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test. Main outcome measure: Primary outcome variable was duration from induction to delivery. The secondary outcome variables included: duration of labour stages, maximal dosage and total amount of oxytocin used, the use of analgesia, abnormalities in fetal heart rate and episodes of uterine hyperstimulation. We also recorded mode of delivery, together with maternal and neonatal outcome. Results: One hundred and four patients participated in this study. The active phase of labour was shorter in group B compared with group A, but this difference was not statistically significant (2.6 ± 2 vs 3.3 ± 2.9, p = 0.07). In group A there were six caesarean deliveries and in group B only three. No significant differences were found when the other outcome parameters were compared.

The objective of this single-center, randomized, controlled trial was to investigate the relationship between VAP and various methods of oral health care. All patients included in the study (n=142) were on mechanical ventilation with oral intubation at the intensive care unit of the Tokyo Dental College Ichikawa General Hospital. They were divided into two groups, one receiving standard oral health care (Standard group), and the other receiving oral health care using an oral moisture gel instead of water (Gel group). After removal of the intubation tube, biofilm on cuff of the tube was stained with a disclosing agent to determine the contamination level. Factors investigated included sex, age, number of remaining teeth, intubation time, fever >38.5degreeC, VAP, cuff contamination level, and time required for one oral health care session. No VAP occurred in either group during the study period. The level of cuff contamination was significantly lower in the Gel group than the Standard group, and the time required for one session of oral health care was shorter (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed use of the oral moisture gel as a factor affecting cuff contamination level. Use of an oral moisture gel decreased invasion of the pharynx by bacteria and contaminants together with biofilm formation on the intubation tube cuff. These results suggest that oral health care using an oral moisture gel is effective in preventing cuff contamination.","published_year":2014,"pages":"95-102","journal":"The Bulletin of Tokyo Dental College"},
 {"title":"Interventions for treating painful nipples among breastfeeding women","authors":["Dennis C-L","Jackson K","Watson J"],"abstract":"SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials designed to evaluate any intervention for treating nipple pain among breastfeeding women. Trials using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. The following interventions were eligible for inclusion compared with each other or usual care (i.e. education only): pharmacological (e.g. antifungal creams); non-pharmacological topical treatments (e.g. lanolin); dressings (e.g. hydrogel dressings); nipple protection devices (e.g. breast shells), phototherapy, and expressed breast milk. Nipple pain in women who are feeding with expressed breast milk (i.e. women of infants in neonatal units) is associated with other methods of removing milk from the mother's breast such as manual expression and various types of breast pumps. Nipple pain and subsequent treatment is different in this unique maternal population and thus we excluded women solely feeding with expressed breast milk from this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, evaluated methodological quality, and checked data for accuracy. We sought additional information from several trial researchers. MAIN RESULTS: We included four trials of good methodological quality involving 656 women in the review. The four included trials evaluated five different interventions including glycerine pads, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, and an all-purpose nipple ointment. All studies included education to position the infant at the breast correctly as part of routine postpartum care to both treatment and control groups.Pooled data existed only for the comparison of lanolin versus usual care. We did not pool data for other outcomes due to either heterogeneity in outcome measures or differing interventions.There was no evidence that glycerine gel dressings or breast shells with lanolin significantly improved nipple pain. One trial found no clear differences in nipple pain (at one to three days, four to five days, or six to seven days' post-treatment) between women who applied lanolin or nothing to their nipples. In contrast, the same trial found that women who applied expressed breast milk had significantly lower perceptions of nipple pain following four to five days of treatment than women who applied lanolin. However, this beneficial effect was not maintained after six to seven days of treatment. There were no group differences in nipple pain perceptions at any assessment between women who applied expressed breast milk and women who applied nothing. Women who applied an \"all-purpose nipple ointment\", in comparison to women who applied lanolin, had no improvement in nipple pain after seven days of treatment. There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, or all-purpose nipple ointment improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain.Overall, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any intervention for the treatment of nipple pain. However, one important finding was that regardless of the treatment used, for most women nipple pain reduced to mild levels after approximately seven to 10 days' postpartum. The provision of anticipatory guidance regarding usual time to pain reduction may be a useful strategy in assisting women to continue to breastfeed and to do so exclusively. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain as assessed using GRADE was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, breast shells with lanolin, lanolin alone, or the all-purpose nipple ointment significantly improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. The results from these four trials of good methodological quality suggested that applying nothing or just expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin.The quality of the evidence for this review did not lead to robust conclusions regarding the objectives assessed. We included only four trials, incorporating 656 women, in the review and all four trials compared varying interventions, participants, study outcome measures, and standards of usual care. The methodological quality of the included studies was good but the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis. BACKGROUND: Leading health authorities all recommend exclusive breastfeeding to six months' postpartum. While most women initiate breastfeeding, many discontinue due to difficulties encountered rather than maternal choice. One common breastfeeding difficulty is painful nipples. Research has identified poor infant positioning or latch as a common cause of painful nipples. While many different interventions designed to reduce nipple pain in breastfeeding women have been evaluated, it is unclear which intervention is the most effective treatment. An understanding of nipple pain and treatment options are needed to improve breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates and to address systematically one of the most frequent difficulties encountered by breastfeeding women. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of all interventions in the resolution or reduction of nipple pain and the impact of the interventions on other outcomes such as nipple trauma, nipple infections, breast mastitis, breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity, and maternal satisfaction. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and scanned secondary references.","published_year":2014,"pages":"CD007366","journal":"The cochrane database of systematic reviews"},

There were two science education courses in the study; one was for 36 inservice teachers, while the other one was for 32 preservice teachers. Both of the courses included the philosophy of science, the instruction about student alternative conceptions and theories of conceptual change, and some classroom activities for science education. The data sources were based upon these teachers' questionnaires, written responses to open-ended questions and interviews. The findings derived from this study revealed that both inservice and preservice teachers, to a certain extent, changed their views toward the nature of science when completing the courses. Many of them might reinterpret and reconstruct their views about science during the courses, and their views had progressed toward more constructivist-oriented. This study also suggested that the instruction about student alternative conceptions and conceptual change theories was more helpful than direct instruction about the philosophy of science in changing teachers' views about science.","published_year":2006,"pages":"363-375","journal":"Teaching & Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies"},

Parents generally have reported satisfaction with such care and have perceived it to be equally effective as inperson care. Here we report on the use of school-based asynchronous telemedicine to connect children with DD with primary care providers. Materials and Methods: We developed Tele-Health-Kids, a school-based program using asynchronous telemedicine to connect children with DD with their primary care physician for the care of minor illnesses. We surveyed parents at enrollment and after the child’s first telemedicine visit to assess satisfaction. We describe 4 cases that illustrate benefits, particularly for children with DD and challenging behaviors, suggesting that asynchronous telemedicine may actually be superior to traditional in-office visits in some circumstances. Results: Most parents expressed a high level of satisfaction with the program. Benefits identified include decreased stress to the child and the parents as well as increasing the likelihood of a successful medical examination due to greater cooperation by the child. Visits using asynchronous or ‘‘store and forward’’ telemedicine technology may be superior in some situations by allowing the visit to be performed at a pace that can be adjusted to the needs of the child with DD. Conclusions: More research in the use of asynchronous telemedicine for children and youth with DD, particularly for children with DD and challenging behaviors, is needed.

Whether adolescent consumption of other highly palatable solutions may also affect alcohol drinking in adulthood is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adolescent consumption of four solutions: water, sucrose, sucrose-milk and milk on ethanol drinking in adult rats. Rats had limited access to one of the four solutions from day PND 29 to PND 51 and were subsequently trained to consume ethanol (E) using a sucrose (S) fade-out procedure. Adolescent consumption of sucrose and sucrose-milk solutions increased intake of 2.5% E when it was combined with 10% S but it had no effect on the drinking of 10% E alone. Adolescent consumption of milk and sucrose-milk significantly decreased the intake of 10% E when it was combined with 10% S, and milk significantly reduced 10% E consumption alone and when it was combined with 5% S. Adolescent exposure to the sucrose-milk and sucrose solutions was also found to increase sucrose and sucrose-milk consumption. Our findings suggest adolescent exposure to sucrose increases, whereas, exposure to milk reduces ethanol consumption in adult rats. Our results may provide a new theoretical approach to the early prevention of alcoholism.","published_year":2009,"pages":"179-85","journal":"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior"},

 {"title":"Suppression of hypoglossal motoneurons during the carbachol-induced atonia of REM sleep is not caused by fast synaptic inhibition","authors":["Kubin, L.","Kimura, H.","Tojima, H.","Davies, R. O.","Pack, A. I."],"abstract":"The depression of upper airway motor activity that develops during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep is a major factor allowing upper airway obstructions to occur in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. Microinjections of carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, into the dorsal pontine tegmentum of chronically instrumented cats produce REM sleep. In acutely decerebrate cats, carbachol induces postural atonia, eye movements and a depression of the motor output to respiratory pump and upper airway muscles. In lumbar motoneurons, the depression of activity is due to a glycinergic inhibition that has the same characteristics during natural REM sleep in chronic cats and carbachol-induced atonia in decerebrate cats (Neurophysiology, 57 (1987) 1118-1129). The mechanisms that lead to the suppression of upper airway motoneuronal activity during REM sleep are unknown. In this study, we assessed whether the depression of hypoglossal (XII) nerve activity induced by pontine carbachol injections is caused by inhibitory amino acids acting within the XII nucleus. In decerebrate, paralyzed and artificially ventilated cats, we recorded the activities of both XII nerves (genioglossal branches), one phrenic and a cervical motor branch (to monitor postural activity). Postural atonia and respiratory depression were induced by pontine carbachol injections. The inhibitory amino acid receptor antagonists, strychnine (glycine receptors) or bicuculline (GABAA receptors), were injected (100-250 nl; 1.0-2.5 mM) into one XII nucleus (the other served as control) in an attempt to reduce or abolish the depression subsequently induced by pontine carbachol. Prior to the carbachol injections, both antagonists caused similar elevations of XII nerve activity on the treated side (30-40%). However, following carbachol, the XII nerve activity on the treated side was depressed to about 25% of the (pre-antagonist and pre-carbachol) control level, whereas the depression on the untreated side was slightly greater, to 10-15% of the control. Additional injections of antagonists during the carbachol-induced depression produced no further increase in nerve activity. This minor effect of the antagonists on the carbachol-induced depression of XII nerve activity was in contrast to the marked disinhibitory effects that both antagonists had on the XII nerve response to electrical stimulation of the lingual nerve. The latter was used as a control for the ability of strychnine and bicuculline to exert disinhibitory effects within the XII nucleus. Thus, there is little, if any, contribution of these inhibitory amino acids to the depression of XII motoneurons during the carbachol-induced, REM sleep-like postural and respiratory depression; mechanisms other than fast synaptic inhibition must be involved.","published_year":1993,"pages":"300-12","journal":""},

M."],"abstract":"Background. Vascular calcification is common in diabetes but the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Methods. To investigate the pathogenesis, we first examined the histology of inferior epigastric arteries from diabetic and non-diabetic patients undergoing a renal transplant. To examine the role of hyperglycaemia, bovine vascular smooth muscle cells (BVSMCs) were incubated with normal (5 mM) or high glucose (25 mM) for 48 or 72 h. Results. The results demonstrated that diabetic patients, compared with non-diabetic patients, had significantly greater calcification and increased expression of the bone matrix proteins osteopontin, type I collagen, bone sialoprotein and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The in vitro studies demonstrated that high glucose increased the expression of the osteoblast transcription factor core binding factor alpha subunit 1 (Cbfa1) and its downstream protein osteocalcin by 1.9-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, and ALP activity by 1.5-fold. These findings were blunted in the presence of an inhibitor to protein kinase C. High glucose also significantly enhanced calcification in BVSMC in a time-dependent manner (2.20 ± 0.50 vs 1.35 ± 0.55 μmol/mg, day 7; 5.04 ± 1.35 vs 3.12 ± 0.92 μmol/mg, day 14; P < 0.05). High glucose also induced the secretion of bone morphogenetic protein-2, a known osteoinductive factor, and further increased the secretion normally seen during calcification by 43% at day 7 and 57% at day 14. Conclusions. These results demonstrate that vascular calcification in patients with diabetes is a cell-mediated process characterized by a phenotypic change of VSMCs to osteoblast-like cells with increased bone matrix protein expression, and that hyperglycaemia may directly induce these changes. © Copyright 2006 Oxford University Press.","published_year":2006,"pages":"3435-3442","journal":""},

 {"title":"The possible role of vasculo-mechanical factors in joint patho-physiology","authors":["M., Beverly","D., Murray","J., Urban","P., Winlove"],"abstract":"Purpose: Historically intraosseous pressure (IOP) was found to be raised in early arthritis and osteonecrosis. Steroid use and embolic bone diseases were also associated with a raised IOP. More recent research has suggested that the subchondral region may be important in cartilage nutrition. It is probable that high pressures occur in the subchondral region of weight bearing joints. This study was carried out to explore the mechanical and hydrodynamic forces around joints in use. A stepwise approach was used to explore subchondral bone perfusion. Methods: IOP was measured initially in the cancellous bone of the femoral head, femoral condyle and upper tibia of anaesthetised adult New Zealand White rabbits. A needle was inserted into subchondral bone and connected by a saline filled line to pressure transducers and a chart recorder. Clamps could be placed on the proximal femoral artery and vein. A load of one body weight was applied longitudinally through the limb as required. Similar upper tibial IOP measurements were made in conscious walking volunteers. Results: 1. Basal intraosseous pressure varied widely from 12-60 mmHg with a cardiac pulse volume (PV) of 3-10 mmHg. In 43 separate studies there was a close correlation between the IOP and its associated pulse volume, r = 0.801, p<0.001. There was also an underlying respiratory wave (RW). 2. Drugs affected IOP, closely reflecting the systemic circulation pressure changes. 3. Occlusion of the proximal femoral artery causes loss of pressure (IOPa) and pulse volume to virtually nil. 4. Occlusion of the proximal vein causes a rise in pressure (IOPv) with preservation of PV and RW. 5. One body weight load raises IOP with preservation of PV and RW. 6. During arterial occlusion loading caused very little rise in IOP. 7. During venous occlusion loading caused an augmented rise in IOP with preservation of the PV. 8. Perfusion at the needle tip is best understood as a function of IOPv minus IOPa. 9. Simultaneous recordings from the femoral head, condyle and upper tibia during vascular occlusion and loading show the same changes at all sites. 10. Triple recording from the femoral head, condyle and upper tibia during injection of saline shows pressure is transmitted through each whole bone but not across the joint. 11. In man upper tibial pressure during standing, slow walking and fast walking shows large IOP changes of up to 1000mmHg. Conclusions: IOP is mainly a reflection of arterial supply pressure and not venous back pressure. When IOP is studied combined with alternate proximal arterial and venous occlusion, actual cancellous bone perfusion at the needle tip can be studied. A single IOP measurement in isolation is meaningless. Compartment syndromes could probably be studied in the same way IOPv - IOPa. IOP is reduced by proximal arterial occlusion and increased by proximal venous occlusion and physical loading. There is an element of compartmentalisation in each bone. Bones are hydrodynamically separated by joints. High pressure fluctuations arise in subchondral bone during weight bearing activity. There may be protective anatomical modifications of the subchondral bone microcirculation. Arthritis may be a partly 'vasculo- mechanical' disease. Subchondral bone appears to act as a compressible perfused sponge.","published_year":2015,"pages":"A270-A270","journal":"Osteoarthritis and Cartilage"},

Pulmonary arterial hypertension can be classified into five categories according to Venice classification: (1) Idiopathic PAH; (2) Familial PAH; (3) PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, HIV infection, drugs and toxins or other (thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders, splenectomy); (4) PAH associated with significant venous or capillary involvement, which includes pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH); (5) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. PAH can also be secondary to chronic hypoxic lung disease as part of the \"cor-pulmonale\" syndrome, and also secondary to left sided heart disease, but these conditions are usually distinguished from those listed here., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists in pulmonary arterial hypertension., SEARCH STRATEGY: A search was carried out using the CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the reference section of retrieved articles. Searches are current as of August 2005., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were selected by two reviewers., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently selected studies; assessed study quality; and extracted data. We analysed outcomes as continuous and dichotomous data., MAIN RESULTS: In this updated version of the review, we added two RCTs. Altogether, five RCTs met the entry criteria of the review (reporting eight group comparisons). The studies were of short duration (12-16 weeks), recruiting a total of 482 participants. Three studies compared a non-selective ERA (bosentan) with placebo, one compared bosentan with sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) , and one compared a selective ERA (sitaxsentan) with placebo. Over a 12-16 week period ERAs improved exercise capacity, improve Borg dyspnoea score, some measures of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics (pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac index) in symptomatic patients with mainly idiopathic PAH. The effect of ERAs on mortality was not significant. The most severe side effect, hepatic toxicity, was not common., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: ERAs in conjunction with conventional therapy over 12 to 16 weeks can improve exercise capacity, Borg dyspnoea scores and several cardiopulmonary haemodynamics variables in patients mainly with idiopathic PAH. The data on mortality do not currently show a benefit of this class of drugs on this endpoint. Additional assessment of this outcome is important in order to establish whether there is evidence that ERAs have an impact on the risk of death.

He presented with significant ataxia and impairments in balance, coordination, and midline awareness. He was unable to remain standing for greater than 10 seconds with a rolling walker and maximum assistance, and could not tolerate ambulation due to dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over the next three weeks, GT's progress with gait training remained slow and limited. He was only able to ambulate 30 feet with a small base quad cane (SBQC) and moderate assistance, and experienced frequent loss of balance. Both gait training without body weight support and body weight supported treadmill training were trialed during Physical Therapy (PT) without significant improvement. He continued with a discoordinated gait with variable cadence and step length. Program Description: Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) was consulted to co-treat with PT by instigating rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS). GT's gait was entrained to a rhythm using a metronome and live acoustic guitar. Setting: Inpatient rehabilitation facility. Results or Clinical Course: GT demonstrated excellent ability to synchronize his gait and cadence to a 3-beat tempo. During his first session, he exhibited improved gait and cadence symmetry and increased his ambulatory distance to 100 feet with SBQC and contactclose guard. During his second session, he ambulated 180 feet with contact guard-minimum assistance without an assistive device. Upon discharge from rehabilitation, he was ambulating household distances independently with a SBQC, and up to 250 feet with close-contact guard and no assistive device. Discussion: There is a rich network of audio-motor pathways at the level of the brainstem and cerebellum. RAS utilizes these networks to entrain motor output patterns to rhythmic cues. The use of RAS as a gait training intervention has been shown to translate into improved gait patterns in patients with stroke, brain injury, Parksinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Conclusion: RAS is an effective intervention for improving gait parameters including balance, cadence, step length, and turning for gait impairments after cerebellar stroke.","published_year":2015,"pages":"S101","journal":"PM and R"},

 {"title":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an update on diagnosis and management issues in older adults.","authors":["Nazir,S.A.","Erbland,M.L."],"abstract":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating disease of the elderly that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite being a treatable and preventable disease, the prevalence continues to rise because of the worldwide epidemic of smoking. COPD is associated with enormous healthcare costs. It has systemic effects, and common co-morbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting and osteoporosis may all be linked through a common systemic inflammatory cascade. Depression, anxiety and malnutrition are also common in elderly COPD patients. These factors not only affect quality of life (QOL) but also compliance with therapy. Malnutrition is an independent predictor of mortality and poor outcome. Spirometry is essential for the diagnosis of COPD, but the criteria defining airflow limitation are not clear cut for elderly patients and could result in over-diagnosis. However, older patients perceive their symptoms differently, and COPD could also be under-diagnosed in this population. Acute exacerbations result in worsening symptoms that necessitate additional treatment, and may cause a more rapid decline in lung function and QOL. The management of elderly patients with COPD should encompass a multidisciplinary approach. An evaluation of patients' nutritional status and mental health should be undertaken, in addition to assessing their lung function and functional impairment. Significant underlying co-morbidities should be evaluated and treated to derive the maximal benefit of therapy. Specific therapy for COPD should start with cessation of exposure to the most important risk factor, tobacco smoke. Smoking cessation rates in the elderly have not declined, and this may reflect an underlying reluctance by physicians to counsel and offer smoking cessation therapies to the elderly. Unlike oxygen therapy in hypoxaemic patients, bronchodilators and corticosteroids do not decrease mortality in COPD patients and they are primarily directed towards symptom relief. However, they do have a positive effect on QOL and exacerbation rates. The choice of delivery devices for inhaled medications is important in the elderly, and patients' inhaler technique and manual dexterity should be frequently assessed. Pulmonary rehabilitation and nutritional supplementation are other important components of care. End-of-life issues should be adequately addressed in the elderly with COPD, and an approach integrating curative and palliative interventions is recommended.","published_year":2009,"pages":"813-832","journal":"Drugs & Aging"},

Here, we review the effects of Ramadan fasting on the health and function of the eye. Materials and Methods: Literature records in PubMed/ MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Iran Medex databases as well as proceedings of related meetings from January 1986 to March 2014 were systematically reviewed. The search key words was based on the terms \"Ramadan Fasting,\" \"Ramadan,\" \"Islamic Fasting,\" \"Fasting in Ramadan\" accompanied with one of the eye, tear drop, myopia, intraocular pressure (IOP), tear break up time, basal tear secretion, refractive error, and visual acuity. Results: Predawn water loading and dehydration in the evening are shown to increase and decrease IOP and tear secretion, respectively. Ocular blood flow is changed in Ramadan fasting, and patients with ocular vein occlusion may experience more frequent attacks. There are no or minimal fluctuations in visual acuity and refractive errors, but most of them are decompensated after Ramadan. Conclusion: Although the influence of fasting in different eye parameters is evaluated in several studies, there are no or only limited studies conducted on patients suffering from glaucoma, damage to ophthalmic vasculature, tear dysfunction, and minimal visual acuity. Such studies are required to make a definite decision before fasting is declared harmless to these patients.","published_year":2014,"pages":"786-791","journal":"Journal of Research in Medical Sciences"},

In the present study the effects of methylphenidate in two different dosages were assessed with regard to mental fatigue, pain and cognitive functions in persons who had suffered a traumatic brain injury. Methods: Fifty-one subjects were included and 44 completed the study. The treatment continued for 12 weeks, including three treatment periods with no medication for 4 weeks, administration of low dose methylphenidate (up to 5mgx3) for 4 weeks and normal dose methylphenidate (up to 20mgx3) for a further 4 weeks. The patients were randomized into three groups where all groups were given all treatments. Results: Significantly reduced mental fatigue, assessed with the Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS) and increased information processing speed (coding, WAIS-III), were detected. The SF-36 vitality and social functioning scales were also improved significantly. Pain was not reduced by methylphenidate. The positive effects of treatment were dose-dependent, with the most prominent effects being at 60mg methylphenidate/day spread over three doses. Observed side-effects were increased blood pressure and increased heart rate. Conclusions: Methylphenidate was generally well-tolerated and it improved long-lasting mental fatigue and processing speed after traumatic brain injury. Copyright © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

 {"title":"Fibre type dependent expression of glucose transporters in human skeletal muscles","authors":["Gaster, M."],"abstract":"The family of glucose transporters (GLUT) is responsible for the facilitated uptake of glucose into mammalian cells. The expression pattern of GLUTs in human skeletal muscle tissue was not well described. Immunohistochemistry and stereology were used to study the fibre type dependent expression of GLUT proteins in human skeletal muscle tissue. During the ontogenesis of skeletal muscle only a few GLUTs were present with a distinct expression pattern: GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT4 and GLUT11. GLUT1 was expressed in human skeletal muscle cells during gestation, but the expression is markedly reduced around birth and was further reduced to undetectable levels within the first year of living. GLUT3 protein expression appears at gestation week 18 and disappears postnatally. GLUT4 protein is diffusely expressed in muscle cells throughout gestation, whereas after birth the characteristic surface-related localisation appears, as seen in adult muscle fibres. The inducing factor for GLUT reorganisation perinatally is at present unknown. GLUT4 is expressed in all adult human skeletal muscle fibres and is predominantly localised at the PM. GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT5, GLUT8 and GLUT12 have previously been associated with adult muscles, but their expression level in muscle fibres was below detection thresholds. GLUT11 was exclusively expressed in slow fibres in adult skeletal muscles tissue. The function of GLUT11 remains unclear at present, but it could be speculated whether GLUT11 could be a basal GLUT in slow fibres. Based on our observations, GLUT4 seems to be responsible for basal glucose uptake, at least in fast fibres, and insulin stimulated glucose uptake. Transitions in GLUT isoforms were only seen in damaged muscle fibres and were not observed in obesity, T2D, long-lasting endurance training or de- and reinnervation. GLUT1 and GLUT3 were induced, and GLUT11 expression was lost in regenerating muscle fibres in primary myopathy. The responsible mechanism was suggested to be dedifferentiation of damaged muscle fibres. The GLUT4 immunoreactivity pattern in muscle sections allowed us to estimate GLUT4 expression in slow and fast fibres by stereology. GLUT4 expression in vastus latealis was fibre type dependent, more abundant in slow versus fast fibres. The GLUT expression in slow and fast fibres was individually regulated. Age was associated with a reduced GLUT4 expression in fast fibres. Obesity and T2D were associated with a reduced GLUT4 expression in slow fibres. The GLUT4 expression per fiber surface area was associated with fibre volume and was fiber type dependent. Reduced GLUT4 expression in muscle fibres may reduce the responsiveness of glucose uptake and thereby be part of pathogenesis of insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. Our comprehensive studies of the expression of glucose transporters in human skeletal mucles shows that the GLUT expression is higly regulated with only few GLUT isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle tissue depending on fibertype, age, direct fiber damage and metabolic stress. © 2007 The Authors.","published_year":2007,"pages":"1-48","journal":"APMIS"},

The literature revealed that there are significant differences between different ethnic groups in terms of attainment levels, social background and levels of special educational need. My aim was to include, specifically, the voice of Pakistani young people and their experience of school. I am approaching this research from a feminist perspective with the aim of uncovering marginalized voices and hidden experiences. In view of previous research which has focussed on the experience of school: my research question is: How do Pakistani young people interpret their experiences of school? I carried out semi-structured interviews with six primary school pupils from Pakistani backgrounds from year six, aged between 10 to 11 years old from the same school. The epistemology underpinning the research is critical realism, which emphasises the personal and social contexts within which people experience what is “real”. I analysed the narratives from these interviews using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). IPA is an interpretative, idiographic approach to methodology which is used to generate super-ordinate and sub-ordinate themes. The analysis found seven super-ordinate themes: the emotional experience of learning, the cultural impact of the school curriculum, the importance of enduring friendships, the impact of the segregation between communities, the impact of gendered power struggles, the impact of bullying and the impact of cultural identity. The possible implications for school staff focused on understanding the benefits of the curriculum, the cultural differences experienced in the school, ethos and anti-racist/sexist programmes. For Educational Psychologists, implications focused on awareness-raising and work with young people from different communities. Recommendations for future research are also discussed including the usefulness of IPA for drawing out rich and detailed narratives providing depth in the analysis.","published_year":2014,"pages":null,"journal":""},

Eligible patients (n = 502) were randomly allocated to receive an SMS reminder of their appointment (intervention group) or no reminder (control group). The non-attendance rate was significantly lower in the reminder group (26.3%) than the non-reminder group (39.8%). In multivariate logistic regression, age, sex and nationality did not affect attendance rates but having their first contact with the hospital (OR = 7.40) and not receiving an SMS reminder (OR = 0.56) were significant factors in non-attendance. All patients surveyed about their perceptions of the SMS reminder (n = 76) reported they would like to continue to receive SMS reminders in the future.","published_year":2014,"pages":"317-323 7p","journal":"Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal"},

The aim of this study was to examine associations between transactional sex and HIV risk among women and men in alcohol-serving venues in Cape Town, South Africa. We surveyed 1,989 women and 2,468 men attending alcohol-serving venues in Cape Town, South Africa to assess transactional sex behavior (i.e., receiving money or goods in exchange for sex), alcohol and drug use, history of childhood abuse, current relationship violence, and sexual risk behaviors. Among both women and men, trading sex was related to higher alcohol use, greater likelihood of drug use, substance use in sexual contexts, and a greater likelihood of experiencing physical and sexual violence. Compared to other women, women who traded sex reported a greater proportion of condom-unprotected sex; this relationship was not found for men. Analyses showed that men were almost twice as more likely to report trading sex for items, including money or alcohol, than women (9.7 vs. 5.8 %). Overall, men who traded sex were similar to their female counterparts. Similar associations between trading sex and different risk behaviors were found among women and men with limited economic means and substance use problems. Future research should more closely study transactional sex in high-risk venues as it relates to violence and should examine men who trade sex as a potential bridge population between heterosexual women and men who have sex with men.","published_year":2014,"pages":"296-308","journal":"Prevention Science"},

Data sources: We conducted two literature searches to identify studies that evaluated self-management interventions involving physiotherapists and occupational therapists in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), SPORTdiscus, and REHABDATA databases. Study selection: Four investigator pairs screened article title and abstract, then full text with inclusion criteria. Selected articles (n = 57) included adults who received a chronic disease self-management intervention, developed or delivered by a physiotherapist and/or an occupational therapist compared with a control group. Data extraction: Four pairs of investigators performed independent reviews of each article and data extraction included: (a) participant characteristics, (b) the self-management intervention, (c) the comparison intervention, (d) outcome measures, construct measured and results. Data synthesis: A total of 47 articles reported the involvement of physiotherapy in self-management compared with 10 occupational therapy articles. The type of chronic condition produced different yields: arthritis n = 21 articles; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic pain n = 9 articles each. The theoretical frameworks most frequently cited were social cognitive theory and self-efficacy theory. Physical activity was the predominant focus of the self-management interventions. Physiotherapy programmes included disease-specific education, fatigue, posture, and pain management, while occupational therapists concentrated on joint protection, fatigue, and stress management. Conclusions: Physiotherapists and occupational therapists make moderate contributions to self-management interventions. Most of these interventions are disease-specific and are most frequently based on the principles of behaviour change theories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

 {"title":"A Java-based tool for the design of classification microarrays.","authors":["Meng D.","Broschat SL.","Call DR."],"abstract":"Classification microarrays are used for purposes such as identifying strains of bacteria and determining genetic relationships to understand the epidemiology of an infectious disease. For these cases, mixed microarrays, which are composed of DNA from more than one organism, are more effective than conventional microarrays composed of DNA from a single organism. Selection of probes is a key factor in designing successful mixed microarrays because redundant sequences are inefficient and limited representation of diversity can restrict application of the microarray. We have developed a Java-based software tool, called PLASMID, for use in selecting the minimum set of probe sequences needed to classify different groups of plasmids or bacteria. The software program was successfully applied to several different sets of data. The utility of PLASMID was illustrated using existing mixed-plasmid microarray data as well as data from a virtual mixed-genome microarray constructed from different strains of Streptococcus. Moreover, use of data from expression microarray experiments demonstrated the generality of PLASMID. In this paper we describe a new software tool for selecting a set of probes for a classification microarray. While the tool was developed for the design of mixed microarrays-and mixed-plasmid microarrays in particular-it can also be used to design expression arrays. The user can choose from several clustering methods (including hierarchical, non-hierarchical, and a model-based genetic algorithm), several probe ranking methods, and several different display methods. A novel approach is used for probe redundancy reduction, and probe selection is accomplished via stepwise discriminant analysis. Data can be entered in different formats (including Excel and comma-delimited text), and dendrogram, heat map, and scatter plot images can be saved in several different formats (including jpeg and tiff). Weights generated using stepwise discriminant analysis can be stored for analysis of subsequent experimental data. Additionally, PLASMID can be used to construct virtual microarrays with genomes from public databases, which can then be used to identify an optimal set of probes.","published_year":2008,"pages":"328","journal":"BMC bioinformatics"},
 {"title":"A Descriptive study of cognitive status three years following motor stroke","authors":["Hinkle J.L."],"abstract":"Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and a leading cause of disability in the rapidly aging population. In the post-stroke period, intact cognition is needed to form new memories, devise problem solving strategies, or recognize dangerous situations. This is especially true for patients who have had a motor stroke, who most often have a short hospital stay and then return home to devise new strategies, cope with deficits, and attempt to make a good functional recovery. Furthermore, advanced age and decline in cognitive status are key factors in institutionalization following stroke yet cognitive status 3 years after one particular type of ischemic stroke, motor stroke, has received minimal attention. The purpose of this study, part of a larger 3 year follow-up study following patients after stroke, was to describe cognitive status 3 years following motor stroke. At 3 years of the 60 patients available, 11 had died, 30 consented to a home visit and 19 were interviewed by telephone. The mean age of patients at the time of follow-up was 64 years and cognitive status was measured using three instruments. The mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score for the group was 27.53 (+/- 2.74); there were no statistically significant differences in men with a mean score of 27.29 (+/- 3.26) and women with mean scores of 27.75 (+/- 2.26). Mean scores on the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (Cognistat) for the group were 69.67 (+/- 15.62); there were no statistically significant differences between men with a mean score of 69.50 (+/- 19.36) and women with mean scores of 69.81 (+/- 12.10).

Central metal, stereochemical configuration and functional groups of the substitutes give to the organometallic compounds very special and selective properties. These properties have been used successfully in selective-antitumor-targeting, as well as anti-arthritic drugs. In the present investigation we study the influence of two organometallic compounds on the inhibition of crystallization of hydroxyapatite. These compounds are complexes of Ti(IV) with the general formula [Cp2Ti(aa)2](2+)2Cl(-), where Cp = eta (5)-C5H5 cyclopentadienyl and aa the amino acid glycine or alanine. The experiments were conducted according to the constant composition technique in supersaturated solutions containing calcium and phosphate ions. The kinetic results indicate a surface diffusion controlled mechanism of the hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals. The experiments prove that the presence of [Cp2Ti(Ala)2](2+)2Cl(-) and [Cp2Ti(Gly)2](2+)2Cl(-) complexes affects drastically the profile formation rate of the HAP crystals under biological conditions. The complex with the amino acid alanine provides a stronger inhibition of the formation rate comparing to the complex with glycine.

DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Thirty patients with colon cancer and their spouses completed interviews in their homes. Most patients (83%) had undergone partial colon resection, and 77% had no evidence of cancer in adjacent lymph nodes. Twelve of the patients (40%) had a colostomy at the time the data were collected. METHODS: Patients and spouses participated in semistructured interviews that elicited information concerning their reactions to a diagnosis of colon cancer, to a colostomy (if present), to changes in lifestyle, to their satisfaction with information they received, and to ways that health care professionals could assist them with the illness and treatments. Content analysis was used to analyze the interview data and to group data into inductively derived categories. Interrater reliability was obtained by having 2 researchers independently code the data. RESULTS: Spouses tended to regard a colon cancer diagnosis more negatively than did patients. Both patients and spouses reported that fear of cancer's recurrence was their greatest concern. Most also reported lifestyle changes (80%) as a result of the illness; but the patients reported more changes in their functional ability, whereas spouses reported more changes in their roles and relationships. Half of the patients and most of the spouses (75%) reported a favorable reaction to the colostomy. Approximately half of the couples expressed satisfaction with the information they received; they reported a need for more information about treatments and management of side effects. When asked how professionals could help them, most couples stated that they wanted more information about the expected course of recovery. CONCLUSION: Spouses should be included in health assessment and teaching because they regard the illness more negatively than do patients. Both patients and spouses desire information that will help them to understand the typical course of recovery, assist them to plan for lifestyle changes, and enable them to manage the side effects of treatment.","published_year":1999,"pages":"8-17","journal":"Journal of Wound, Ostomy & Continence Nursing"},

Results are presented from a contingent valuation survey in which each individual was asked to value two independent gains in life expectancy. Using split-sample data for question order we are able to study sensitivity to scope by carrying out an internal as well as an external scope test, and to examine whether question order influences sensitivity to scope. Finally, we address whether our results raise some specific concerns regarding the use of web-based surveys. Overall we find that choice of elicitation approach--in this case bottom-up versus top-down--influences the stated willingness-to-pay values leading to order effects and differences in scope sensitivity. Our findings demonstrate that elicitation approach affects the decision-making strategy, suggesting that preferences at least to some extent are reference dependent and constructed during the elicitation task. In addition, our findings indicate some relation between scope insensitivity, time spent on filling out the questionnaire and experience as an Internet panel member.","published_year":2011,"pages":"369-381","journal":"Journal of Environmental Planning and Management"},

We compared these data with those of a third general hospital that did not adopt the guidelines (hospital 3). The parameters considered were total consumption of albumin, consumption per bed, consumption per hospital stay, mean time to discharge, expenditure per bed, and mortality rate.ResultsIn the years 2000 and 2001, the adoption of guidelines reduced albumin consumption in hospitals 1 and 2. In hospital 1, where the release of albumin was carefully controlled by the transfusion service, albumin use per hospital stay decreased 8.7% in 2000 and 7.6% in 2001 from 1999; in hospital 2, use decreased 73.8% and 77.4%, respectively, from 1999.

Several countries have made great strides in the efforts to prevent HIV through mother-to-child transmission. The objective of this study is to assess the determinant and outcome of early diagnosis of HIV infection among HIV-exposed infants in southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional based retrospective cohort study was conducted in a hospital. Medical records of HIV-exposed infants and their mothers enrolled into the program were reviewed. Data entry and analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20 for Windows. RESULTS: A total of 426 HIV exposed infant-mother pairs where both mother and infants received a minimum ARV intervention for PMTCT were included in the study. Two hundred fifty-four (59.6%) of mothers had attended antenatal care (ANC). Of all participants, 234(54.9%) mothers did not receive any PMTCT prophylaxis during ANC, while only 104(24.4) received antiretroviral (ART) as PMTCT prophylaxis and 163(38.3%) claimed that did not observe any infant PMTCT interventions while 135(31.7%) of the infants received single-dose NVPë+ëAZT. About 385(90.4%) infants were not infected at their final infection status. Those mothers who did not attended ANC follow-up, infants on mixed and complementary feeding and infants weaned off and mothers who were in WHO clinical stage III and IV were more likely to have HIV sero positive infant. CONCLUSION: This study showed that 385(90.4%) of the infants were not infected at their final infection status. Therefore, encouraging pregnant women to visit health facilities during their course of pregnancy, focusing on exclusive breast feeding counseling and promotion, and early initiation of antiretroviral treatment to HIV infected pregnant women are recommend","published_year":2014,"pages":"309-309","journal":"BMC research notes"},
 {"title":"The social cost of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs in France, 1997","authors":["Fenoglio, P.","Parel, V.","Kopp, P."],"abstract":"Aim, Design and Setting: The economic costs of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs to French society are estimated using a cost of illness framework. Measurements: For the cause of disease or death (using ICD-9 categories), pooled relative risk estimates from meta-analyses were combined with prevalence data by age and gender to derive the proportion attributable to alcohol, tobacco and/or illicit drugs. The resulting estimates of attributable deaths and hospitalizations were used to calculate the associated health care, law enforcement, productivity and other costs. The results were compared with those of other studies, and sensitivity analyses were conducted by alternative ways of measuring risk attribution and costs. Findings: The use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs cost more than 200 billion francs (FF) in France in 1997, representing 3,714 FF per capita or 2.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Alcohol is the drug that gives rise to the greatest cost in France, i.e. 115,420.91 million FF (1.42% of GDP) or an expenditure per capita of 1,966 FF in 1997. Alcohol takes more than half of the social cost of drugs to society. The greatest share of the social cost of alcohol comes from the loss of productivity (57,555.66 million FF), due to premature death (53,168.60 million FF), morbidity (3,884.0 million FF) and imprisonment (503.06 million FF). Tobacco leads to a social cost of 89,256.90 million FF, that is an expenditure per capita of 1,520.56 FF or 1.1% of GDP. Productivity losses amount to 50,446.70 million FF, with losses of 42,765.80 million FF as a result of premature death and 7,680.90 million FF linked to morbidity. Health care costs for tobacco occupy second place at 26,973.70 million FF. Illicit drugs generate a social cost of 13,350.28 million FF, that is an expenditure per capita of 227.43 FF or 0.16% of GDP. Productivity losses reach 6,099.19 million FF, with 5,246.92 million FF linked to imprisonment and 852.27 million FF to premature death. The cost of enforcing the law for illicit drugs occupies second place at 3,911.46 million FF, followed by health care costs of 1,524.51 million FF. Conclusion: Substance abuse exacts a considerable toll from French society in terms of illness, injury, death and economic costs. Copyright © 2003 S.

C.","Sacktor, N.","Pardo, C. A."],"abstract":"Despite effective and widely available suppressive anti-HIV therapy, the prevalence of mild neurocognitive dysfunction continues to increase. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a multifactorial disease with sustained central nervous system inflammation and immune activation as prominent features. Inflammatory macrophages, HIV-infected and uninfected, play a central role in the development of HIV dementia. There is a critical need to identify biomarkers and to better understand the molecular mechanisms leading to cognitive dysfunction in HAND. In this regard, we identified through a subtractive hybridization strategy osteopontin (OPN, SPP1, gene) an inflammatory marker, as an upregulated gene in HIV-infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Knockdown of OPN in primary macrophages resulted in a threefold decrease in HIV-1 replication. Ectopic expression of OPN in the TZM-bl cell line significantly enhanced HIV infectivity and replication. A significant increase in the degradation of the NF- kappa B inhibitor, I kappa B alpha and an increase in the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of NF- kappa B were found in HIV-infected cells expressing OPN compared to controls. Moreover, mutation of the NF- kappa B binding domain in the HIV-LTR abrogated enhanced promoter activity stimulated by OPN. Interestingly, compared to cerebrospinal fluid from normal and multiple sclerosis controls, OPN levels were significantly higher in HIV-infected individuals both with and without neurocognitive disorder. OPN levels were highest in HIV-infected individuals with moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Moreover, OPN was significantly elevated in brain tissue from HIV-infected individuals with cognitive disorder versus those without impairment. Collectively, these data suggest that OPN stimulates HIV-1 replication and that high levels of OPN are present in the CNS compartment of HIV-infected individuals, reflecting ongoing inflammatory processes at this site despite anti-HIV therapy.","published_year":2011,"pages":"382-392","journal":"Journal of NeuroVirology"},

We describe our initial clinical experience and short-term (30-day) outcome with percutaneous implantation of the self-expanding CoreValve bioprosthesis. Methods and results: From December 2008 through June 2009, we performed PAVI procedures (third-generation CoreValve ReValvingÂ® system prosthesis) in 21 consecutive patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis: 8 males and 13 females, aged 80.9 Â± 4.8 years, logistic EuroSCORE 17.5 Â± 6.9%, mean aortic pressure gradient 53.6 Â± 23 mmHg, aortic valve area 0.43 Â± 0.09 cm2/m2, and left ventricular ejection fraction 51.5 Â± 9.4%. Procedural success rate was 100%, and the 30-day combined endpoint of MACE was 0% (no death, myocardial infarction or stroke). Pressure gradients improved significantly with a mean final pressure of 3.0 Â± 2 mmHg. Overall functional status, as assessed by the New York Heart Association class, improved from 3.0 Â± 0.5 to 1.4 Â± 0.4 within 30 days post procedure. Conclusion: PAVI using the CoreValve ReValvingÂ® system for selected patients with severe aortic stenosis and high surgical risk is feasible with a high technical success rate, low periprocedural mortality/morbidity and remarkable clinical and hemodynamic improvement.

Shock index (SI) (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) is a simple marker of worse outcomes after injury. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of SI in predicting outcomes. We hypothesized that SI predicts mortality in geriatric trauma patients.\rMETHODS: We performed a 4-year (2007-2010) retrospective analysis using the National Trauma Data Bank. Patients 65 years or older were included. Transferred patients, patients dead on arrival, missing vitals on presentation, and patients with burns and traumatic brain injury were excluded. A cutoff value of SI greater than or equal to 1 (sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 79%) was used to define hemodynamic instability. The primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcome measures were need for blood transfusion, need for exploratory laparotomy, and development of in-hospital complications. Multiple logistic regressions were performed.\rRESULTS: A total of 485,595 geriatric patients were reviewed, of whom 217,190 were included. The mean (SD) age was 77.7 (7.1) years, 60% were males, median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 14 (range, 3-15), median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 9 (range, 4-18), and mean (SD) SI was 0.58 (0.18). Three percent (n = 6,585) had an SI greater than or equal to 1. Patients with SI greater than or equal to 1 were more likely to require blood product requirement (p = 0.001), require an exploratory laparotomy (p = 0.01), and have in-hospital complications (p = 0.02). The overall mortality rate was 4.1% (n = 8,952). SI greater than or equal to 1 was the strongest predictor for mortality (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.3; p = 0.001) in geriatric trauma patients. Systolic blood pressure (p = 0.09) and heart rate (p = 0.2) were not predictive of mortality.\rCONCLUSION: SI is an accurate and specific predictor of morbidity and mortality in geriatric trauma patients. SI is superior to heart rate and systolic blood pressure for predicting mortality in geriatric trauma patients. Geriatric trauma patients with SI greater than or equal to 1 should be transferred to a Level 1 trauma center.\rLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic/epidemiologic study, level III.","published_year":2014,"pages":"1111-5","journal":"The journal of trauma and acute care surgery"},

F."],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the durability of a minimal composite sealant restoration (MCR) with that of a glass ionomer sealant restoration (GSR). METHODS: Under local anaesthesia, a MCR and a GSR were placed in the mouths of selected patients; allocation of restoration type was made randomly. All restorations were placed by one operator using standard procedures and were then assessed clinically at baseline and thereafter every 6 months. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients, with a total of 66 pairs of restorations, were reviewed for up to 27 months. Assessment criteria were based upon the amount of sealant lost, the state of the pit restoration and the occurrence of caries. There were no cases of recurrent caries, and a total of only four pit restorations failed, three (4.5%) GSRs and one (1.5%) MCR. Three MCRs and seven GSRs required further additions of sealant. Survival analysis was carried out using the loss of more than a third of the sealant as the failed status. At this level, the MCRs had a significantly greater Median Survival Time (MST) (24.7 months) than the GSRs (20.7 months) (p < 0.05). Only seven (10.6%) of the MCRs lost more than a third of their sealant as compared with 17 (25.8%) of the GSRs. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the durability of the MCR compared with the GSR in the treatment of occlusal caries. However, there was significantly better retention of the fissure sealant over the composite restoration than over the glass ionomer.","published_year":1996,"pages":"399-405","journal":"J Dent"},

Methods: A randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted in 40 patients with mild to moderate stages of AD. All patients were daily treated with rivastigmine transdermal patch at a stable dose of 4.6 mg and randomized into two groups: physical exercises or control. The exercise program consisted of aerobic, flexibility, strength and balance movements, twice a week for 6 months. Main outcomes were Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease scale (QOL), Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (ADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and \"Time Up and Go Test\". Results: Thirty-four patients completed the study. After 6 months, there was a significant improvement in QOL of patients randomized to physical exercise group (P < 0.05).

Multiple previous unsuccessful procedures increase the difficulty of successful repair, leaving many patients with no option other than permanent urinary and/or fecal diversion. We report our experience with coloanal sleeve anastomosis (Soave procedure) as a salvage procedure for complex rectourinary fistulas. Between 1994 and 2005, eight males (median age, 60 (range, 33-72) years) had Soave procedure in our institution. Four fistulas were the result of radical prostatectomy and four followed anterior resection for rectal cancer after radiochemotherapy. The location of the fistulas was bladder (n = 5) and urethra (n = 3). Five patients had previous attempts at surgical repair (median, 2 (range, 1-3) operations). The Soave procedure was chosen as first-line treatment because of fistula size (20 mm and 30 mm) in two patients and because of concomitant severe radiation proctitis in one patient. Morbidity was 38 percent. All patients had a temporary ileostomy, which was successfully reversed in seven patients. One patient required ileal pouch-anal anastomosis on postoperative Day 1 because of necrosis of the descended colon. Two patients had recurrent fistulas at two and three months respectively. One patient had moderate problems with this recurrent fistula and had his stoma closed, but the other patient required a permanent ileostomy. Soave procedure is an effective treatment for complex rectourinary fistula in the setting of high-dose pelvic radiation or after failed previous repair attempts.","published_year":2006,"pages":"1379-83","journal":"Diseases of the colon and rectum"},

METHODS: Standardized scenarios of mother-child interactions (50 mother-child dyads of very low birth weight infants (VLBWI), birth weight<1500g) were videotaped in two perinatal centers (PC-A, PC-B). The videos were reviewed and scored using a standardized instrument. In both centers, parents were integrated in the daily care by pediatric nurses, while additionally PC-A had a structured parental training program. RESULTS: PC-A and PC-B were comparable regarding patient spectrum and number of admissions of VLBWIs/year. Both centers had similar care values with respect to the \"baby friendly\" initiative. No significant differences were seen in characteristics of patients (gestational age, birth weight, postnatal age) and mothers (age, parity, marital status, professions). However, in scoring the mother-child interactions significant differences were observed: In contrast to PC-B the recorded behavior in mother-child dyads of PC-A was significantly more often scored as interaction-oriented. CONCLUSION: A dedicated, structured, and actively encouraging training program for parents of preterm infants was found to be more strongly correlated toward neurodevelopmental enhancing mother-child-interactions than an approach of merely integrating parents into daily care routine.","published_year":2015,"pages":"205-10","journal":"Early Hum Dev"},

However, UW contains the colloid Hydroxyethyl starch (HES), which may cause perfusion deficits due to its high viscosity. Recently, a new CS preservation solution, Hypothermosol (HTS), was introduced which contains the less viscous colloid Dextran. The aim of this study was to assess HTS as a cold storage solution for preservation of the liver.\rMETHODS: In an isolated perfused rat liver model, hepatocellular damage was assessed after 24 hours of CS. Liver enzymes were measured during reperfusion with Krebs-Henseleit Buffer. Bile was collected during reperfusion as a parameter of liver function.\rRESULTS: CS using HTS showed a significant decrease of ALT and LDH levels (as compared to UW) at all time points during reperfusion. For LDH these results where most pronounced at t=10 min (84 +/- 7.09 vs 113 +/- 7.57: p < 0.05) and t=30 min (149.2 +/- 9.68 vs 194 +/-6.52: p< 0.05).

The fundamental cause of obesity is an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure in which diet is a key, modifiable risk factor. While the food and nutrient intake of Malaysian adults is documented, data on the extent to which each food group contributes to total calorie ingested has not been reported to date. A cross-sectional study was conducted among Malaysian adults (n = 360) aged 18-58 years in a public university. Through face-to-face interview, nutrient intake data was collected using a previously validated food frequency questionnaire. The calorie acquired from different food groups was calculated as a percentage of total calorie intake. Body weight, height and waist circumference were also measured. Food group-wise, the highest calorie derived from vegetables, drinks and confectioneries were by normal weight, obese and overweight participants, respectively. Positive correlations were established between percentage of calorie from eggs and waist circumference (p = 0.035) and percentage of calories from sauces and body mass index (p = 0.013). Percentage of calorie from drinks was positively correlated with all three measures of adiposity, namely; body weight (p = 0.010), body mass index (p = 0.044) and waist circumference (p = 0.020). Adiposity was associated with intake of a larger amount of calories from drinks, confectioneries as well as from eggs and sauces and consumption of lesser calories from vegetables.

However, the risk factors for ongoing cognitive decline in patients with PD-MCI are not clearly defined. 51 patients with PD-MCI were prospectively followed-up for a minimum of 2 years. Subjects were classified as MCI converters (n=15) or MCI non-converters (n=36) based on whether they were subsequently diagnosed with PD dementia. We explored cognitive profiles and neuroanatomical characteristics of PD-MCI converters using voxel based morphometry (VBM) of grey matter (GM) density and region of interest based volumetric analysis of the substantia innominata (SI). PD-MCI converters showed more severe cognitive deficits in frontal executive functions, immediate verbal memory and visual recognition memory compared with PD-MCI non-converters. VBM analysis revealed that PD-MCI converters had significantly lower GM density in the left prefrontal areas, left insular cortex and bilateral caudate nucleus compared with that in PD-MCI non-converters. The mean normalised SI volume was significantly smaller in both PD-MCI converters (1.19±0.35, p<0.001) and PD-MCI non-converters (1.52±0.27, p<0.001) compared with that in controls (1.87±0.19). PD-MCI converters had a significantly smaller normalised SI volume than PD-MCI non-converters (p<0.001). Our data show that atrophy in the frontostriatal areas and cholinergic structures, as well as frontal lobe associated cognitive performance, may act as predictors of dementia in PD-MCI patients, suggesting distinctive patterns of cognitive profiles and a neuroanatomical basis for progressive PD-MCI.","published_year":2014,"pages":"7-16","journal":"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry"},

Magnesium sulfate is currently being studied in clinical trials as a potential fetal neuroprotective agent. The purpose of this study was to determine whether intrapartum magnesium sulfate therapy has an effect on the umbilical venous concentrations of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha at delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Women with singleton gestations >32 weeks with no clinical indications for magnesium sulfate therapy (preeclampsia or tocolysis) and either clinical chorioamnionitis or prolonged rupture of membranes were recruited for the study. Consenting patients were randomly assigned, in a double-blinded fashion, to receive either magnesium sulfate (6-g load then 2 g/hr) or matched volumes of lactated Ringer's solution until delivery. Fetal blood specimens were obtained by aspiration of the umbilical vein after cord clamping but before placental separation. Umbilical cytokine levels were measured with a sensitive and specific immunoassay. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were randomly assigned to groups and received either magnesium sulfate (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11). There were no differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics between groups. The umbilical venous ionized magnesium concentration was significantly higher in the magnesium sulfate group (2.32 +/- 0.27 mg/dL vs 1.23 +/- 0.15 mg/dL; P <.001). There were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to umbilical levels of interleukin-1beta (1.5 pg/mL [1.5-58] vs 1.5 pg/mL [1.5-10]; P =.5); interleukin-6 (8.5 pg/mL [1-1000] vs 11.2 pg/mL [1-113]; P =.9); or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (16 pg/mL [7.6-20.3] vs 16.6 pg/mL [8.3-22.2]; P =.5). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study the intrapartum administration of magnesium sulfate does not appear to affect the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in fetal blood at delivery.","published_year":2001,"pages":"1320-1324 5p","journal":"American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology"},

All patients who received vertebral augmentation for vertebral compression fractures were evaluated. The collected data included patient characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, and medication exposure) and repeat vertebral augmentation. Kaplan-Meier and stratified Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed for analyses. The overall incidence of repeat vertebral augmentation was 11.3% during the follow-up until 2010. Patients with the following characteristics were at greater risk for repeat vertebral augmentation: female sex (AOR=1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-2.36), advanced age (AOR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.32-2.08), diabetes mellitus (AOR=4.31; 95% CI: 4.05-5.88), cerebrovascular disease (AOR=4.09; 95% CI: 3.44-5.76), dementia (AOR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.69-2.33), blindness or low vision (AOR=3.72; 95% CI: 2.32-3.95), hypertension (AOR=2.58; 95% CI: 2.35-3.47), and hyperlipidemia (AOR=2.09; 95% CI: 1.67-2.22). Patients taking calcium/vitamin D (AOR=2.98; 95% CI: 1.83-3.93), bisphosphonates (AOR=2.11; 95% CI: 1.26-2.61), or calcitonin (AOR=4.59; 95% CI: 3.40-5.77) were less likely to undergo repeat vertebral augmentation; however, those taking steroids (AOR=7.28; 95% CI: 6.32-8.08), acetaminophen (AOR=3.54; 95% CI: 2.75-4.83), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (AOR=6.14; 95% CI: 5.08-7.41) were more likely to undergo repeat vertebral augmentation.

To assess this health condition, a valid and reliable questionnaire is required. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Sexual Quality of Life-Female (SQOL-F) questionnaire in Iran. Method. Forward-backward procedure was applied to translate the questionnaire from English into Persian. After linguistic validation and pilot examination, a cross-sectional study was carried out and psychometric properties of the Iranian version of questionnaire were tested. One hundred reproductive aged, married, healthy and sexually active women completed the questionnaire. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), and test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient) analyses. In addition, content, and face validity were assessed and the factor structure of the questionnaire was extracted by performing exploratory factor analysis. Results: The mean age of participants was 33 (SD = 8.07) years, and the mean quality of sexual life score was 86.4 (SD = 1.78) ranging from 36 to 108. Most women were housewife (n = 92). Reliability evaluation revealed high internal consistency and good test-retest reliability. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.73 and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.88. The mean scores for the content validity index (CVI) and the content validity ratio (CVR) were 0.91 and 0.84, respectively. The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) indicated a four-factor solution for the questionnaire that jointly accounted for 60.8% of variance observed. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that the Iranian version of SQOL-F questionnaire has good psychometric properties and it will be useful to assess the female sexual quality of life in reproductive health care settings. © 2013 Maasoumi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","published_year":2013,"pages":null,"journal":"Reproductive Health"},

We report three patients with hypothyroidism of childhood onset after a normal neonatal thyroid-stimulating hormone screening who showed deceleration in linear growth, spasticity in the lower limbs with deformity, mild intellectual impairment, and multiple calcifications in the basal ganglia and subcortical areas. The neurologic symptoms were not progressive but were irreversible in spite of thyroxine treatment. Motor disturbances commonly observed in postnatal-onset hypothyroidism are similar to those of cerebral palsy. Specific distribution of intracranial calcifications may result from metabolic derangement as a result of hypothyroidism, although the mechanism of calcification is not fully understood.

METHOD: All general dental practices located within the region of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board (EHSSB) in Northern Ireland were contacted and invited to participate. A questionnaire assessed practice characteristics, patient-active prevention, practice policies and employment strategies. The principal general dental practitioner (GDP) was invited to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-seven per cent of practices participated. Nearly all the practices provided patient-active prevention; however, lower proportions of dentists provided advice on diet for dental caries (3%), oral hygiene instruction, fluoride toothpaste use and interdental cleaning (7%) with each new course of dental treatment. 'Patient-active' prevention practices were 5.8 times more likely to employ a hygienist and 5.3 times more likely to have a practice policy to screen for oral cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the employment of a hygienist is central to the reorientation of primary dental care.

P."],"abstract":"The failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is defined as protracted or recurrent pain, mainly in the lower back and/or legs, even after previous anatomically successful spinal surgery. Treatment of such patients commonly involves difficulties since neither medical therapy nor repeated back surgery does not result in adequate pain relief. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a minimally invasive procedure that allows physicians and patients to define the effect of therapy just before permanent implantation. Both trial stimulation and permanent implantation are fully reversible. Early treatment with SCS has been shown to be very effective in correctly selected FBSS patients and therefore this procedure should be preferred over back resurgery. Clinical studies have demonstrated that CSC provides a sustained, long-term, 50% or more pain relief in over 60% of the patients and makes it possible to reduce the use of analgesics and to improve quality of life and functional status, thus permit many patients to resume work. Many patients told about fair therapeutic effects and the occurrence of mild side effects. Thus, SCS is an accessible alternative to traditional therapy. It is the treatment of choice in drug-resistant FBSS patients where recurrent neuropathic pin persists after surgery and analgesics are no longer effective.","published_year":2007,"pages":"53-7; discussion 57-9","journal":"Zh Vopr Neirokhir Im N N Burdenko"},

In patients with a functional PCL the decision which design is chosen depends largely on the favour and training of the surgeon.The objective of this study is to determine whether the patient's perceived outcome and speed of recovery differs between a posterior cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty and a posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Patients who are admitted for primary unilateral TKA due to primary osteoarthrosis are included when the following inclusion criteria are met: non-fixed fixed varus or valgus deformity less than 10 degrees, age between 55 and 85 years, body mass index less than 35 kg/m(2) and ASA score (American Society of Anaesthesiologists) I or II. Patients are randomized in 2 groups. Patients in the posterior cruciate retaining group will receive a prosthesis with a posterior cut-out for the posterior cruciate ligament and relatively flat topography. In patients allocated to the posterior stabilized group, in which the posterior cruciate ligament is excised, the design may substitute for this function by an intercondylar tibial prominence that articulates with the femur in flexion. Measurements will take place preoperatively and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively.At all measurement points patient's perceived outcome will be assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcome measures are quality of life (SF-36) and physician reported functional status and range of motion as determined with the Knee Society Clinical Rating System (KSS). DISCUSSION: In the current practice both posterior cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized designs for total knee arthroplasty are being used. To date no studies have been performed determining whether there is a difference in patient's perceived outcome between the two designs. Additionally, there is a lack of studies determining the speed of recovery in both designs as most studies only determine the final outcome. This randomised controlled study has been designed to determine whether the patient's perceived outcome and speed of recovery differs between a posterior cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty and a posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty.

This knowledge exchange began with formal interviews. Thematic analysis of the interviews form the basis of this article. Participants drew attention to health systems issues, the meaning and experience of discontinuities in care for patients at personal and community levels, and the significance of social supports. Other concerns raised by participants were typical of the literature on healthcare disparities. Providers at the front lines of care offer a rich source of insight into the operation of disparities, pointing to mechanisms rarely identified in traditional quantitative studies. They are also well positioned to advocate for more equitable care at the local level.","published_year":2014,"pages":"175-81","journal":"Palliative & supportive care"},

Lysozyme is a bacteriolytic enzyme located within the lysosomes of phagocytic cells including leukocytes.\rMETHODS: We measured serum concentrations of lysozyme by a standard turbidimetric method in both a murine model of intraabdominal infection and in trauma patients with intraabdominal abscesses or other acquired infections.\rRESULTS: In mice with intraabdominal abscess secondary to cecal ligation and puncture (n = 35) serum lysozyme activity increased compared with sham-operated controls (n = 20; p < 0.001). In trauma patients with intraabdominal abscess after injury and surgery (n = 19), there was also an increase in serum lysozyme activity compared with controls (n = 15; p < 0.001) or with patients with lung infection (n = 21; p < 0.001). The increase of serum lysozyme activity occurred before intraabdominal sepsis was clinically apparent.\rCONCLUSIONS: In this study, serum lysozyme concentration has a high specificity related to the presence of an intraabdominal abscess and is an indirect measure of the sequestration of leukocytes to the site of an established or developing collection of intraabdominal pus. The estimation of serum lysozyme may be an aid to differentiate critically ill patients with a potential occult intraabdominal abscess.","published_year":1994,"pages":"16-21","journal":"Surgery"},

Investigations were carried out to see whether this \"obesity paradox\" can be explained by biases. METHODS: The association between weight status and mortality in the US population ages 35 and above with CVD was investigated. Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-2010, linked to mortality records through 2011. To minimize biases resulting from illness-induced weight loss, a reference category consisting of individuals who have always maintained normal weight was used. Age-standardized mortality rates and Cox models were estimated, comparing overweight/obesity (body mass index (BMI) >/=25.0 kg m(-2) ) to normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg m(-2) ). RESULTS: The paradox was present among those with overweight/obesity at the time of survey (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.01). However, when the reference category was limited to the always-normal-weight, the paradox disappeared (HR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.95-1.41). When analysis was additionally confined to never-smokers, mortality risks were significantly higher in the overweight/obesity group (HR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.07-2.15; P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide support for the hypothesis that lower mortality among individuals with CVD and overweight/obesity is a product of biases involving reverse causation and confounding by smoking.","published_year":2015,"pages":"2485-90","journal":"Obesity (Silver Spring)"},

It is one of the most common causes of physical, cognitive, and psychomotor disturbances that affect the quality of life, work, and social reintegration of individuals. Until now, we did not have evidence of structural abnormalities shown by traditional imaging methods. We describe a series of instruments that confirm PCS with satisfactory evidence., METHODS: We conducted a clinical prospective study of 19 adult patients selected from a pool of 320 adults who had MHI. The cognitive, executive, and memory functions of subjects were examined within the first 72 hours using neuropsychological tests. These results were analyzed with neurological examination and functional MR/spectroscopy., RESULTS: Neurobehavioral alterations were found in 47% of cases, with posttraumatic amnesia. Around 55% of subjects experienced physical disturbances such as headache and postural vertigo due to PCS. The spectroscopy reports revealed neurometabolite disturbances in 54% of cases, particularly N-acetylaspartate (Naa) and the Naa/lactate ratio in the frontal lobe. We observed a relationship between metabolite disturbances in spectroscopy and the digit span backward test (P = .045)., CONCLUSIONS: This first diagnostic strategy supports with scientific evidence the presence of PCS in MHI. We identified physical and neuropsychological abnormalities from this group, affecting the areas of memory and learning. Evidence of neurometabolite disturbances were found specifically in the frontal lobe. It is necessary to complete comparative follow-up for an extended period of time.

One theory states that the apex of the odontoid separates from the body because of a fracture. The intact alar and apical ligaments pull the fractured segment superiorly. The independent vascular supply of the apex allows the fractured bone to remain viable and remodel into the smooth, corticated bone characteristic of an os odontoideum. However, there are no publications with direct radiographic evidence supporting the theory., CASE REPORT: In this paper, the authors present a 7-year-old child with a fracture through the apical odontoid epiphysis, extending into the body of the dens. Serial imaging studies demonstrate progressive separation of the apex from the body of the odontoid. The fractured segment begins to remodel and assume the classic form of an os., CONCLUSION: The authors consider this case to be radiographic evidence supporting an acquired/traumatic origin of os odontoideum. Further, the mechanism of fracture through a cartilaginous epiphysis may explain the formation of an os after \"normal\" x-ray images or following seemingly minor trauma.","published_year":2013,"pages":"2111-5","journal":"Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery"},

Radiographic data and CRP measurements were available for 294 individuals from CLEAR 1 (median (interquartile range (IQR) 25-75) disease duration of 1 (0.6-1.6) year) and in 407 persons from CLEAR 2 (median (IQR 25-75) disease duration of 8.9 (3.5-17.7) years). In CLEAR 1, in adjusted models, the minor allele of rs2808630 was associated with total radiographic score (incident rate ratio 0.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.74), P-value=0.0051). In CLEAR 2, the minor allele of rs3093062 was associated with increased plasma CRP levels (P-value=0.002). For each rs3093062 minor allele, the plasma CRP increased by 1.51 (95% CI 1.15-1.95) mg dl-1 when all the other covariates remained constant. These findings have important implications for assessment of the risk of joint damage in African Americans with RA.","published_year":2015,"pages":"446-451","journal":"Genes and Immunity"},

There is also a need to reduce unnecessary transfusion to enhance patient safety. A retrospective audit was conducted on the appropriateness of red cell usage here. It was hoped to identify practices in red cell usage which can be improved. Study Design/Methods: In a consecutive 8-day period in September 2011, all red cell requests from inpatient wards and intensive care units were reviewed. Requests from emergency room, operating theatres and outpatient clinics were excluded. A standardized algorithm based on Singapore Ministry of Health 2011 Guidelines was used to determine appropriateness of each request. Requests were appropriate if transfused for: 1) active bleeding 2) hemoglobin (Hgb) <7 g/dL and <2 units requested or >3 units requested and post-transfusion Hgb did not exceed 11 g/dL 3) Hgb <8 g/dL in the perioperative period; and 4) Hgb between 7 and 10 g/dL if any risk factor present. A risk factor was regarded as any of the following: symptoms of anemia, heart or lung disease, or aged above 65 years. Requests were inappropriate if transfused for: 1) Hgb >10 g/dL without active bleeding 2) Hgb between 7 and 10 g/dL without any risk factor; and 3) Hgb >8 g/dL in the perioperative period without any risk factor. It was excessive if: 1) >2 units requested for Hgb >7 g/dL without risk factor and posttransfusion Hgb exceeded 10 g/dL; and 2) >3 units requested for Hgb <7 g/dL and post-transfusion Hgb exceeded 11 g/dL. Results/Findings: A total of 302 red cell requests were reviewed. Of these, 6% (18 cases) were deemed inappropriate. The Table summarizes the type of inappropriate indication. Common problems identified were: 1) transfusion for chronic compensated anemia even when alternatives were available 2) transfusion of more than one unit when one may suffice; and 3) high hgb thresholds in asymptomatic, young patients without co-morbidities. Conclusion: The rate of inappropriate red cell transfusion was determined to be 6%, translating to approximately 67.5 units a month. The common problems identified will be used to educate physicians on ways to minimize unnecessary red cell use. This can help reduce cost for patients and release blood units for more appropriate usage. (Table Presented).","published_year":2013,"pages":"276A-276A","journal":"Transfusion"},

AIMS: To develop a decision model based on classification and regression tree (CART) analysis for the prediction of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: A total of 420 patients with acute pancreatitis were enrolled. Study participants were randomly assigned to the training sample and test sample in a 2:1 ratio. First, univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to identify predictors associated with SAP in the training sample. Then, CART analysis was carried out to develop a simple tree model for the prediction of SAP. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed in order to assess the performance of the model. The prediction model was then applied to the test sample. RESULTS: Four variables (systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS], pleural effusion, serum calcium, and blood urea nitrogen BUN]) were identified as important predictors of SAP by logistic regression analysis. A tree model (which consisted of pleural effusion, serum calcium, and BUN) that was developed by CART analysis was able to early identify among cohorts at high (79.03%) and low (7.80%) risk of developing SAP. The area under the ROC curve of the tree model was higher than that of the APACHE II score (0.84 vs. 0.68; P < 0.001). The predicted accuracy of the tree model was validated in the test sample with an area under the ROC curve of 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: A decision tree model that consists of pleural effusion, serum calcium, and BUN may be useful for the prediction of SAP.","published_year":2011,"pages":"3664-3671","journal":"Dig Dis Sci"},

While this area of brain dysfunction in critical care is rapidly advancing, striking limitations in use of terminology related to delirium internationally are hindering cross-talk and collaborative research. In the English literature, synonyms of delirium such as the Intensive Care Unit syndrome, acute brain dysfunction, acute brain failure, psychosis, confusion, and encephalopathy are widely used. This often leads to scientific \"confusion\" regarding published data and methodology within studies, which is further exacerbated by organizational, cultural and language barriers. We undertook this multinational effort to identify conflicts in terminology and phenomenology of delirium to facilitate communication across medical disciplines and languages. The evaluation of the terminology used for acute brain dysfunction was determined conducting communications with 24 authors from academic communities throughout countries/regions that speak the 13 variants of the Romanic languages included into this manuscript. In the 13 languages utilizing Romanic characters, included in this report, we identified the following terms used to define major types of acute brain dysfunction: coma, delirium, delirio, delirium tremens, délire, confusion mentale, delir, delier, Durchgangs-Syndrom, acute verwardheid, intensiv-psykose, IVA-psykos, IVA-syndrom, akutt konfusion/forvirring. Interestingly two terms are very consistent: 100 % of the selected languages use the term coma or koma to describe patients unresponsive to verbal and/or physical stimuli, and 100% use delirium tremens to define delirium due to alcohol withdrawal. Conversely, only 54% use the term delirium to indicate the disorder as defined by the DSM-IV as an acute change in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking and altered level of consciousness. Attempts towards standardization in terminology, or at least awareness of differences across languages and specialties, will help cross-talk among clinicians and researchers.","published_year":2008,"pages":"1907-15","journal":"Intensive care medicine"},

D.","Pryce, S. Q.","Lewis, P. T."],"abstract":"Background: Not much research has compared the social cognition of normal persons vs. those with schizophrenia across different Western cultures. The present study attempted to test this not only within a standard social cognition context, where making a proper behavioral judgment would depend on attending to relevant social constraint information, but within different Western culture contexts (North American, Netherlands, United Kingdom). We would hypothesize that differential social constraint effects found between schizophrenia and non-schizophrenic groups would be more apparent in the North American sample as opposed to the Netherlands and United Kingdom samples, given the greater emphasis on individualism in the former than in the latter 2 cultures. Methods: A total of 154 persons across North America, Netherlands, and United Kingdom gave informed consent to participate. There were 63 normal controls, 73 with schizophrenia, and 18 patient controls. Subjects read 3 health-related essays, allegedly written under conditions of either low or high social constraint. Subjects then answered questions relating to Agency (eg, how much control the writer had in writing the essay); Person-disposition (eg, how well one might be able to predict an essay-writer's future behavior); etc. Additional information was gathered. Results: A series of 3 Way ANCOVAs (controlling for gender and age) examined main effects of constraint, diagnostic group, and culture, and any interaction effects on attributions of Agency and Person- disposition. While results showed that persons without schizophrenia were more likely to be affected by constraint information than persons with it, such a difference was not most pronounced in the North American sample. We did find 1 significant constraint, diagnostic group, and culture interaction relating to essay 2 Agency, but the culture that distinguished itself was the United Kingdom, not North America. Two other relevant interactions were trends, 1 for essay 3 Agency, and 1 for essay 1, Person-disposition, but not quite in the predicted direction. Conclusion: While it appears that Culture exerts some effects in interaction with constraint and diagnostic group, such effects do not appear to conform to a pattern. While clearly the fact that all of the cultures are Western, and thus that fact alone may well explain the negligible effects of such a factor, the interaction effects that emerged are worthy of explanation.","published_year":2011,"pages":"220-221","journal":"Schizophrenia Bulletin"},

Our local data from a University-based Primary Care Clinic (PCC) demonstrated that only 19% of patients with visit(s) to the PCC for COPD between 5/1/14 and 9/30/14 had undergone spirometry testing. The purpose of our interprofessional continuing education (CE) and quality improvement (QI) interventions was to change clinical practice by doubling the spirometry rates for COPD patients in the PCC in five months. Methods: We assembled an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals (HCP) and implemented PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) QI techniques as well as an interprofessional CE program entitled Web-based, Interactive Professional Education in COPD (WipeCOPD™). We assigned clinicians 1-1.5 hours of CE per month from the WipeCOPD™ program, which was accompanied by 30 minutes per month of “live” interactive, small group education by a COPD expert. We interviewed clinicians with high spirometry rates to determine how/why their rates were higher than average, providing insight into what was working well and we met HCP with low rates of ordering spirometry to discuss perceptions, barriers and potential solutions to this problem. The PCC bought spirometers and we trained the clinic support staff in proper techniques of performing spirometry by hands-on, small group and online education sessions. We added the following information technology reminder to the medical record: “Has your COPD patient ever had spirometry?” We collected follow-up data between 10/1/14 and 2/28/15. Results: Baseline COPD prevalence in the PCC was 3.8% and increased to 4.4% during the five months following the interventions, despite not implementing any case-finding questionnaires. Spirometry rates increased from 19% (14/75) in the initial period to 56% (176/312) during the five months of follow up after the interventions. Conclusions: Interprofessional CE and QI interventions improved spirometry rates nearly three-fold or patients with COPD and improved the recognition of COPD by primary care clinicians. Despite not implementing screening questionnaires, the prevalence of COPD within the PCC significantly increased as well. Clinical Implications: Interactive and high-quality continuing education and quality improvement interventions applied to primary care are associated with real clinical practice changes and these well-defined techniques may be disseminated to other practices as well.","published_year":2015,"pages":null,"journal":"Chest"},

 {"title":"Comparative nutrition of iron and copper","authors":["Winzerling, J. J.","Law, J. H."],"abstract":"The suggestion from nutritional studies with mammals of a link between iron and copper metabolism has been reinforced by recent investigations with yeast cells. Iron must be in the reduced ferrous (FeII) state for uptake by yeast cells, and reoxidation to ferric (FeIII) by a copper oxidase is part of the transport process. Thus, yeast cells deficient in copper are unable to absorb iron. In an analogous way, animals deficient in copper appear to be unable to move FeII out of cells, probably because it cannot be oxidized to FeIII. Invertebrate animals use copper and iron in ways very similar to vertebrates, with some notable exceptions. In the cases where vertebrates and invertebrates are similar, the latter may be useful models for vertebrate metabolism. In cases where they differ (e.g. predominance of serum ferritin in insects, oxygen transport by a copper protein in many arthropods, central importance of phenoloxidase, a copper enzyme in arthropods), the differences may represent processes that are exaggerated in invertebrates and thus more amenable to study in these organisms. On the other hand, they may represent processes unique to invertebrates, thus providing novel information on species diversity.","published_year":1997,"pages":"501-526","journal":"Annual Review of Nutrition"},
 {"title":"Differential inhibitory effects of garlic-derived organosulfur compounds on cholesterol biosynthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures","authors":["Gebhardt, R.","Beck, H."],"abstract":"Using primary rat hepatocyte cultures, the potency of several garlic-derived organosulfur compounds to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in tote as well as at early and late steps of this metabolic pathway was compared. Concerning early steps, allicin significantly inhibited incorporation of [C-14]acetate into nonsaponifiable neutral lipids already at concentrations as low as 10 mu M, while diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan were effective above 100 mu M only. Likewise, inhibition in response to the two vinyl-dithiins started at 500 mu M. If [C-14]acetate was replaced by [C-14]mevalonate, inhibition due to allicin, diallyl disulfide, and allyl mercaptan disappeared suggesting that HMGCoA-reductase was the target of inhibition. In contrast, for the vinyl-dithiins a stimulation of mevalonate incorporation was found. Concerning the late step, the potency to exert accumulation of lanosterol presumably by inhibiting lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase decreased in the order allicin > diallyl disulfide > allyl mercaptan = 1,3-vinyl-dithiin >> 1,2-vinyldithiin, the effect of the latter compound being close to zero. With respect to the total inhibition of [C-14]acetate labeling of cholesterol, the half-maximal effective concentration-value of allicin was determined to be 17 +/- 2 mu M compared to 64 +/- 7 mu M for diallyl disulfide and to 450 +/- 20 mu M for allyl mercaptan. Cytotoxicity as determined by the lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay was slightly higher for the two vinyl-dithiins than for diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan, but was apparent only at concentrations higher than 10 mM and, consequently, was irrelevant for the effects described. These results demonstrate that different garlic-derived organosulfur compounds interfere differently with cholesterol biosynthesis and, thus, may provoke multiple inhibition of this metabolic pathway in response to garlic consumption. The fact that allicin was the most effective inhibitor argues against the possibility that its degradation products, namely diallyl disulfide or allyl mercapatan, might mediate its effects, a possibility that might be true, however, in the case of the vinyl-dithiins.","published_year":1996,"pages":"1269-1276","journal":"Lipids"},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Approximately 25% of DPP lifestyle intervention participants (n = 274) completed questionnaires to assess weight history and psychological and behavioral factors at baseline and 6 months after completion of the 16-session core curriculum. The change in variables from baseline to 6 months was assessed with t tests. Multivariate models using hierarchical logistic regression assessed the association of weight outcomes at end of study with each demographic, weight loss history, psychological, and behavioral factor. RESULTS: At end of study, 40.5% had achieved the DPP 7% weight loss goal. Several baseline measures (older age, race, older age when first overweight, fewer self-implemented weight loss attempts, greater exercise self-efficacy, greater dietary restraint, fewer fat-related dietary behaviors, more sedentary activity level) were independent predictors of successful end-of-study weight loss with the DPP lifestyle program. The DPP core curriculum resulted in significant improvements in many psychological and behavioral targets. Changes in low-fat diet self-efficacy and dietary restraint skills predicted better long-term weight loss, and the association of low-fat diet self-efficacy with weight outcomes was explained by dietary behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers who translate the DPP lifestyle intervention should be aware of pretreatment characteristics that may hamper or enhance weight loss, consider prioritizing strategies to improve low-fat diet self-efficacy and dietary restraint skills, and examine whether taking these actions improves weight loss outcomes.","published_year":2013,"pages":"34-40","journal":"Diabetes Care"},

Lumbar and pelvic motions were recorded using a flexible electrogoniometer in 12 healthy subjects during two different tasks in the sitting position. The coordination of the lumbar spine and pelvis was evaluated using the ratio of lumbar and pelvic angles (L/P ratio hereafter) in three motion phases. There were significant differences in the UP ratio values between during the \"forward bending\" and \"rising from a forward flexed position\" phases (P < 0.01). The UP ratio value (similar to-0.7) was consistent during the movement from an erect to a slumped sitting position as the lumbar spine and pelvis moved in opposing directions. This study shows that lumbar-pelvic coordination occurs in the sitting position. Lumbar-pelvic coordination is confirmed even if the movement tasks are different in the sitting position, and these findings show that aspects of a particular movement are dependent on the given movement task. These findings may provide greater insight into the kinematic changes involved in lumber-pelvic coordination, and help clinicians implement sitting exercises conducive to the independence of the patient.

This dermatan sulphate proteoglycan, which is expressed by the vascular endothelium, has been found freely circulating in the bloodstream of healthy subjects. Experimental evidence is accumulating that implicates endocan as a key player in the regulation of major processes such as cell adhesion, in inflammatory disorders and tumor progression. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, and pro-angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF, FGF-2 and HGF/SF, strongly increased the expression, synthesis or the secretion of endocan by human endothelial cells. Endocan is clearly overexpressed in human tumors, with elevated serum levels being observed in late-stage lung cancer patients, as measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and with its overexpression in experimental tumors being evident by immunohistochemistry. Recently, the mRNA levels of endocan have also been recognized as being one of the most significant molecular signatures of a bad prognosis in several types of cancer including lung cancer. Overexpression of this dermatan sulphate proteoglycan has also been shown to be directly involved in tumor progression as observed in mouse models of human tumor xenografts. Collectively, these results suggest that endocan could be a biomarker for both inflammatory disorders and tumor progression as well as a validated therapeutic target in cancer. On the basis of the recent successes of immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer, the preclinical data on endocan suggests that an antibody raised against the protein core of endocan could be a promising cancer therapy. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Life expectancy in Nepal has risen by more than 20 years in the past three decades and is currently 68 years of age. Until recently, Nepal was one of the few nations where men, on average, outlived women. As Nepal moves through the health transition this is no longer the case with recent statistics suggesting that an average life expectancy for females is now 69 years, two years greater than males. The ageing process in Nepal provides both challenges and opportunities for professionals, organisations and researchers. This paper provides an overview of the main issues related to an ageing population in Nepal and draws on research conducted under a British Academy Small Grant (BASG) project which ran from April 2011 until April 2012 in collaboration with the Nepal School of Social Work (NSSW), Kathmandu. Central issues emerging from the research suggest the need for more effective policies, better quality of care provision and perhaps more critically the role of advocacy in age-related concerns.

Improving the quality of handoffs between the operating room (OR) and the intensive care unit (ICU) is particularly important, as the high complexity and instability of the patient population can lead to a higher risk of medical errors. Our aim was to determine if we could intervene to improve the quality of handoffs in children admitted to the ICU postoperatively. METHODS: Intervention: A structured handoff tool was developed using a multidisciplinary approach, which included key participants and a checklist of critical steps. Beginning in May 2012, this tool was instituted for children admitted to the ICU post-operatively. Evaluation: Compliance with key steps was audited in real time using a checklist. Data regarding clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patients were collected and the AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture was administered. RESULTS: Between May 2012 and January 2013, 205 children were admitted to the ICU post-operatively. Overall, handoffs were performed 94% of the time; ranging from 82% in May to 100% starting in August. Attendance by key providers ranged from 37% to 100% and there was 100% compliance with critical steps in the conducted handoffs. Surgical subspecialty, time of return from OR, and ICU length of stay were not associated with frequency of attendance or compliance with handoff. Written positive comments were reported in 15% of handoffs; there were no negative comments. Seventy staff members in the ICU completed the safety culture survey (96% response rate); 67% of respondents disagreed with the statement <<problems often occur in the exchange of information across hospital units>> in contrast with 42% (446/1063) for the hospital overall (P<.001), 13% (2/15) on the previous year's survey in the ICU (P<.001) and 44% for the overall AHRQ benchmark.

All AIS patients treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were included if treated within 270 minutes, and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was known. Primary outcome of the 90-day mRS was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Good outcome was defined as a 90-day mRS score of 0-2. Variables assessed were time from onset to arrival, stroke code, neurologic exam, imaging, laboratories, treatment decision, and treatment (by quartiles).\rRESULTS: Two hundred ninety-one patients were included (49.8% female, mean age 70.6 +/- 16.1, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 10, SD = 8.5).

In the presence of dysphagia and cerebral palsy (CP), careful assessment is required prior to the injection of BoNT-A. Favourable responses to intervention include a reduction in the secretion of saliva and in drooling, as well as psychosocial improvements. BoNT-A is usually well tolerated, although potential side effects should be discussed with the patient and carer.","published_year":2010,"pages":"109-21","journal":"Eur J Neurol"},
 {"title":"Violent crime, suicide, and premature mortality in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders: A 38-year total population study in Sweden","authors":["Fazel S","Wolf A","Palm C","Lichtenstein P"],"abstract":"Background: People with schizophrenia and related disorders are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including conviction of a violent offence, suicide, and premature mortality. However, the rates of, and risk factors for, these outcomes need clarification as a basis for population-based and targeted interventions. We aimed to determine rates and risk factors for these outcomes, and investigate to what extent they are shared across outcomes and are specific to schizophrenia and related disorders. Methods: We undertook a total population cohort study in Sweden of 24-297 patients with schizophrenia and related disorders between January, 1972 and December, 2009. Patients were matched by age and sex to people from the general population (n=485-940) and also to unaffected sibling controls (n=26-357). First, we investigated rates of conviction of a violent offence, suicide, and premature mortality, with follow-up until conviction of a violent offence, emigration, death, or end of follow-up (Dec 31, 2009), whichever occurred first. Second, we analysed associations between these adverse outcomes and sociodemographic, individual, familial, and distal risk factors, for men and women separately, with Cox proportional hazards models. Finally, we assessed time trends in adverse outcomes between 1972 and 2009, for which we compared patients with unaffected siblings, and analysed associations with changes in the number of nights spent in inpatient beds in psychiatric facilities nationwide. Findings: Within 5 years of their initial diagnosis, 139% of men and 47% of women with schizophrenia and related disorders had a major adverse outcome (107% of men and 27% of women were convicted of a violent offence, and 33% of men and 20% of women died prematurely of any cause). During the study, the adjusted odds ratio of any adverse outcomes for patients compared with general population controls was 75 (95% CI 72-79) in men and 111 (102-121) in women. Three risk factors that were present before diagnosis were predictive of any adverse outcome: drug use disorders, criminality, and self-harm, which were also risk factors for these outcomes in unaffected siblings and in the general population. Over the period 1973-2009, the odds of these outcomes increased in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders compared with unaffected siblings. Interpretation: Schizophrenia and related disorders are associated with substantially increased rates of violent crime, suicide, and premature mortality. Risk factors for these three outcomes included both those specific to individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders, and those shared with the general population. Therefore, a combination of population-based and targeted strategies might be necessary to reduce the substantial rates of adverse outcomes in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders.

 {"title":"Caring for dying children: a comparative study of nurses' experiences in Greece and Hong Kong.","authors":["Papadatou D.","Martinson IM.","Chung PM."],"abstract":"The purpose of this transcultural descriptive study was to explore the subjective experiences of 63 oncology and critical care nurses who provide care to dying children in Greece and Hong Kong. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 39 Greek and 24 Chinese nurses who described their experiences and responses to the dying process and death of children. The data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, and nurses' responses were compared for their work setting (oncology versus critical care) and their ethnic background (Greek versus Chinese). Findings revealed that most nurses experience a sense of helplessness when caring for a dying patient and difficulties in their communication with the child and parents during the terminal phase of the disease. The large majority acknowledge that the impending or actual death of a patient elicits a grieving process, which is characterized by a fluctuation between experiencing and avoiding loss and grief. Greek and Chinese nurses differ in their expression of their grief and how they attribute meaning to childhood death. Despite the suffering caused by multiple deaths, nurses report significant rewards from caring for chronically and acutely ill children, and the majority are satisfied with their job, despite the difficulties they encounter, in both countries, mostly as a result of shortage in personnel and cooperation problems with physicians.","published_year":2001,"pages":"402-12","journal":"Cancer nursing"},

In the current study, the affective modulation of the cue-related startle reflex has been used to evaluate changes in the emotional processing of alcohol-related stimuli that occurred after a standard cognitive-behavioral intervention, and to assess the outcome of this intervention. We hypothesized a 'normalization' of the startle inhibition for the alcohol-related cues during the period of treatment. We also assumed that higher startle inhibition at baseline elicited by alcohol cues would predict the relapse on alcohol consumption during treatment.Participants: A total of 98 alcohol-dependent subjects were included who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence. A control group of 72 subjects was selected to match demographic characteristics.Measurements: All patients received a standard cognitive-behavioral therapy once a week throughout the study period.Findings: Results show that the startle response differed significantly after 12 weeks of treatment for alcohol-related, neutral and aversive stimuli between alcohol-dependent patients and controls. Low startle responses at baseline to alcohol cues predicted relapse.Conclusions: These results may indicate that the startle reflex is referred to enduring and permanent processes of cue reactivity, and that the emotional processing of alcohol-associated cues assessed with the affect-modulated startle reflex is less altered by interventions attempting to influence explicit cognitions. Furthermore, lower values of the baseline startle reflex elicited by alcohol-associated stimuli were associated with higher probability of relapse on alcohol use.","published_year":2015,"pages":"195-203","journal":"European Addiction Research"},

Total and individual HoNOS-secure item ratings made by multi-disciplinary teams across the course of a period of admission (mean 15 months) for 180 men were examined. There was significant positive change on the clinical and risk-related scales of HoNOS-secure for patients in the learning disability care pathway (N = 48) between initial and final ratings. In the mental health care pathway (N = 132 patients) an apparent lack of change masked a more complex picture, where initial decline in HoNOS-secure ratings was succeeded by significant improvement. Results suggest that it is challenging to measure clinical and risk-related medium-term clinical outcomes objectively for these patients, particularly in relation to core issues of treatment of mental disorder, and reduction of both problem behaviour and risk to others.

Coordinate My Care (CMC) is a service dedicated to preserving dignity and autonomy at the end of life. Its care pathways enable health professionals from primary and secondary care to put the patient at the centre of health care delivery. This service is underpinned by an electronic solution. The CMC record can be accessed 24/7 by all health and social care professionals who have a legitimate relationship with the patient. The record displays diagnosis, prognosis, advanced care plan, resuscitation status and patients wishes for end of life care patients across London. This article is a review of CMC use and outcomes from August 2010- March 2012. 1087 CMC patient records were analysed. The primary diagnosis was non-cancer in 52.3%, cancer in 46.3% and unknown in 1.4%, 42% of all patients were cared for by generalist only and had no specialist palliative care involvement. At the time of analysis 207 had died. Actual place of death was home 38.6%, care/nursing home 16.4%, hospice 12.1% and 30% in hospital. This equates to 55% of patients dying in their usual place of residence and reflects that 70% died outside of hospital. The CMC service has a well defined pathway underpinned by an electronic solution. It has been shown to change culture and deliver fully integrated, personalised end of life care.

However, little is known about unintended birth among Hispanic immigrants. The purpose of this study is to determine the sociodemographic, including immigration-related, correlates of unintended birth in this population. Data were collected as part of a preventive intervention among pregnant Hispanic immigrants at increased risk for depression (n = 215). The correlates of women's self-reported pregnancy intention (intended, mistimed, unwanted) were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Similar to nationally representative findings, unintended birth was more common among younger women, single women and women not cohabiting with their partners, and women with more children. Additionally, women who had immigrated to the U.S. less than 1 year ago had almost a 4 times greater risk of a mistimed birth (RRR = 3.82, P < 0.05) compared to women who immigrated 1-4 years ago. Women with greater social support scores had a reduced chance of mistimed (RRR = 0.98, P < 0.10) and unwanted (RRR = 0.97, P < 0.05) birth. The findings have implications for development of effective and culturally appropriate family planning programs. They suggest that interventions should target young women, women who have achieved their desired family size, and very recent immigrants.","published_year":2011,"pages":"478-86","journal":"J Immigr Minor Health"},
 {"title":"Sexually aggressive resident behavior in long-term care: Insights from nursing home focus groups","authors":["Rosen, T.","Lachs, M. S.","Pillemer, K."],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Evidence exists suggesting that most sexual aggression against older adults occurs in long-term care facilities. Fellow residents are the most common perpetrators, often due to inappropriate hypersexual behavior caused by dementing illness. This phenomenon, though potentially common and with significant psychological consequences for victims, has received little direct research attention to date. OBJECTIVE: To more fully characterize the spectrum of resident- to-resident sexual aggression (RRSA) in nursing homes. DESIGN: A focus group study of nursing home staff members and residents who could reliably self-report explored all types of resident- to-resident aggression, including sexual behaviors. SETTING: A large urban, not-for-profit long-term care facility in New York City PARTICIPANTS: 96 staff members from multiple clinical and non-clinical occupational groups and 7 residents. MEASUREMENTS: 16 focus groups were conducted. Content was analyzed with nVivo 7 software for qualitative data. RESULTS: 38% of focus groups and 18% of participants reported having seen sexually aggressive resident behavior. 3 types of RRSA were described, with inappropriate touching and physical abuse being the most common. 4 triggers for RRSA incidents were identified, including spousal identity confusion, dementia / disinhibition, wandering, and inappropriate caregiving. RRSA was seen occurring in resident rooms, dining rooms and main and TV lounges. CONCLUSION: RRSA occurs frequently in nursing home settings with important consequences for victims and long-term care facilities. Controlling sexual aggression in nursing homes is made more challenging due to the legitimate and recognized need for residents, even those with advanced dementing illness, to sexually express themselves. Further epidemiologic research is needed to more fully describe the phenomenon, identify risk factors, and design preventative and management strategies.","published_year":2010,"pages":"S6","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society"},

It has not been widely used as an outcome measure in evaluations of emergency care and little is known about the feasibility of measurement, typical values obtained or baseline factors that predict health utility. We aimed to measure health utility after emergency medical admission, to compare health utility to age, gender and regional population norms, and identify independent predictors of health utility.Methods: We selected 5760 patients across three hospitals who were admitted to hospital by ambulance as a medical emergency. The EQ-5D questionnaire was mailed to all who were still alive 30 days after admission. Health utility was estimated by applying tariff values to the EQ-5D responses or imputing a value of zero for those who had died. Multivariable analysis was used to identify independent predictors of health utility at 30 days.Results: Responses were received from 2488 (47.7%) patients, while 541 (9.4%) had died. Most respondents reported some or severe problems with each aspect of health. Mean health utility was 0.49 (standard deviation 0.35) in survivors and 0.45 (0.36) including non-survivors. Some 75% had health utility below their expected value (mean loss 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.33) and 11% had health utility below zero (worse than death). On multivariable modelling, reduced health utility was associated with increased age and lower GCS, varied according to ICD10 code and was lower among females, patients with recent hospital admission, steroid therapy, or history of chronic respiratory disease, malignancy, diabetes or epilepsy.Conclusions: Health utility can be measured after emergency medical admission, although responder bias may be significant. Health utility after emergency medical admission is poor compared to population norms.

This study aimed to determine the salivary microbial composition for 10 HIV-seropositive subjects, before and 6 months after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), compared with that for 10 HIV-seronegative subjects. A conventional culture and two culture-independent analyses were used and consistently demonstrated differences in microbial composition among the three sets of samples. HIV-positive subjects had higher levels of total cultivable microbes, including oral streptococci, lactobacilli, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida, in saliva than did HIV-negative subjects. The total cultivable microbial levels were significantly correlated with CD4+ T cell counts. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which compared the overall microbial profiles, showed distinct fingerprinting profiles for each group. The human oral microbe identification microarray (HOMIM) assay, which compared the 16S rRNA genes, showed clear separation among the three sample groups. Veillonella, Synergistetes, and Streptococcus were present in all 30 saliva samples.

 {"title":"Graft type for femoro-popliteal bypass surgery","authors":["Twine Christopher, P.","McLain Alexander, D."],"abstract":"Background: Femoro-popliteal bypass is implemented to save limbs that might otherwise require amputation, in patients with ischaemic rest pain or tissue loss; and to improve walking distance in patients with severe life-limiting claudication. Contemporary practice involves using autologous vein, polyterafluoroethylene (PTFE) or Dacron as a bypass conduit.This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999 and previously updated in 2002.Objectives: The objective of this review was to determine the most effective type of graft for femoro-popliteal bypass surgery.Search methods: The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched January 2010) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1 for last search). The authors searched reference lists of relevant articles, and handsearched conference proceedings from the British and European Vascular Surgical Societies.Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing femoro-popliteal grafts.Data collection and analysis: Two authors (CT and ADM) screened studies, extracted data and assessed trials.Main results: Thirteen randomised control trials were included with a total of 2313 patients (1955 above knee, 358 below knee bypass surgery). Seven graft types were compared (reversed and in situ autologous vein, PTFE with and without vein cuff, human umbilical vein (HUV), Dacron and heparin bonded Dacron (HBD).Above the knee, there was a benefit in primary patency for autologous vein over PTFE (P = 0.0001) and HUV (P = 0.0003) by 60 months. Dacron showed primary patency benefit over PTFE by 24 months (P = 0.02), continuing to 60 months (P = 0.02). HUV also showed benefit over PTFE by 24 months (P = 0.0003) in one trial. Below the knee, in the one trial there was a significant benefit in primary patency for PTFE with a vein cuff when compared to PTFE alone at all time intervals to 24 months (P = 0.03).Limited data were available for limb survival. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant protocols varied extensively between trials, and in some cases within trials.Authors' conclusions: There was a clear primary patency benefit for autologous vein when compared to synthetic materials for above knee bypasses. In the long term (five years) Dacron confers a small primary patency benefit over PTFE for above knee bypass. PTFE with a vein cuff improved primary patency when compared to PTFE alone for below knee bypasses. Further randomised data is needed to ascertain whether this information translates into improvement in limb survival.","published_year":2010,"pages":null,"journal":""},

TLR3 is located on the cell surface and in cellular endosomes and recognizes double-stranded viral RNA or the synthetic mimic poly rI:rC. Recently, unformulated small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been reported as ligand for surface-expressed murine TLR3. Blockage of TLR3 is achieved by single-stranded DNA. We confirm and expand the observation that poly rI:rC-mediated TLR3 immune activation is blocked in a sequence-, length-, backbone- and CpG-dependent manner. However, human TLR3 is not activated by siRNA, which may be the result of differences in the amino acid composition of the TLR3 loop 1 of mice and humans. Although CD14 was previously described as a co-receptor for murine TLR3 and other nucleic acid-recognizing TLRs, human CD14 acts only as co-receptor to human TLR9, but not TLR3, TLR7 or TLR8. We show that CD14 up-regulates the TLR9 immune response of A, B and C-class oligodeoxynucleotides but down-regulates the phosphoro-diester version of B-class oligodeoxynucleotides., (C) 2012 Muntaz B.

Nonetheless, up to 70% of patients who tolerate an adequate trial of clozapine fail to benefit from or partially respond to this drug. Historically, response to clozapine is defined as 20 or 30% reduction in the 4 psychosis items (delusions, hallucinations, disorganization and paranoia) in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-PS). In a randomized, controlled, single blind, NIMH-sponsored study we evaluated the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as an augmentation strategy for the treatment of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia receiving a stable dose of clozapine with serum levels 4 250 meq/ml for at least 8 weeks, with persistent psychotic symptoms (4 12 in the BPRS psychosis subscale) and no current mood symptoms were included in the acute phase of the study. Patients were randomized to receive 8 weeks of ECT in addition to clozapine or to continue with clozapine treatment for 8 weeks. Patients in the pharmacotherapy arm, who did not respond after 8 weeks, crossed over to the ECT arm and received the combination treatment for another 8 weeks. Using as response criterion 40% reduction in the psychosis items of BPRS, we reported response rates of 50% in the single blinded phase of the study and 48% in the cross-over phase of the study. We report here the results for the open-label follow-up study with maintenance ECT for up to 6 months. Methods: Patients who completed either the blinded or open label phases of the above mentioned study and met the a priori set response criterion of 40% reduction in the BPRS psychosis subscale (BPRS-PS) were included in the study. The continuation phase lasted for up to 24 weeks during which patients received bilateral ECT with the same treatment parameters as in the acute phase. We followed a tapered schedule of 4 weekly ECT, followed by 4 ECT every 2 weeks and 2 monthly ECT for a total of 10 treatments in 6 months. Medication regimen including clozapine remained the same as in the acute phase and no additional psychotropic medications were allowed. Psychopathology ratings were performed at baseline (end of acute phase) before each ECT and at the end of the study. Results: Nineteen patients who met the aforementioned response criteria were offered maintenance ECT for up to 6 months. Thirteen patients agreed to participate maintenance phase. For these patients the mean BPRS-PS was 16.0 (+ 6.94) before the acute course of ECT. Their mean BPRSPS at maintenance baseline was 7.69 (+ 3.66) and at the end of the study 9.2 (+ 4.32). Six of the 13 patients (46.1%) completed the 6-month study (10 maintenance ECT). Seven patients (53.9%) received maintenance treatments for 1-2 months (4-7 maintenance treatments, but opted to discontinue before the completion of 6 months. None of the 13 patients had relapsed at the time they exited the study. For those who completed the 6-month period the mean BPRS-PS was 7.83 (+ 3.6) at baseline and 7.66 (+ 2.48) at the exit. For those who received 4-7 maintenance ECT BPRS-P was 8.0 (+ 3. 83) at baseline and 8.5 (+3.96) at the exit. All 7 patients who received maintenance ECT for less than 6 months stated that they felt well and there was no further need for ECT, or could not continue for practical reasons (mostly lack of social support as outpatients). No patient discontinued the treatment because of side effects or worsening of psychotic symptoms. The combination of ECT and clozapine was generally well tolerated and no unusual side effects were observed. Conclusions: These data suggest that maintenance ECT seems to be protective against relapse for those patients who responded to ECT augmentation to clozapine, at least in the first six months after the acute phase. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and establish the optimal duration and frequency of maintenance ECT.","published_year":2015,"pages":"S404-s405","journal":"Neuropsychopharmacology"},

Design and Methods: With a reliance on data from 4,761 dementia caregivers recruited from eight catchment areas in the United States and followed over a 3-year period, a Cox proportional hazards model was conducted that considered key components of the stress process (e.g., context of care, primary objective and subjective stressors, and resources), duration, and community-based long-term-care use. Results: An analysis of interaction terms in the Cox regression model found that those individuals who utilized in-home help services earlier in their dementia caregiving careers were more likely to delay institutionalization. Implications: The findings suggest the practical importance and cost-effectiveness implications of early community-based service use, and they emphasize the role of timing when one is conceptualizing the proliferation of stress in the dementia caregiving career.

 {"title":"Maternal history of childhood sexual abuse and preterm birth: an epidemiologic review.","authors":["Wosu AC.","Gelaye B.","Williams MA."],"abstract":"History of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is highly prevalent with as many as one in four American women being victims. Exposure to CSA or other early life traumatic experiences has been associated with adverse reproductive and pregnancy outcomes. However, the effects of CSA on preterm delivery (PTB), a leading cause of neonatal mortality, remain poorly understood. The objectives of this review are (i) to synthesize the available research investigating the relationship between maternal history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and preterm delivery (PTB); (ii) to provide suggestions for improving future research on this topic; and (iii) to highlight implications for clinical practice and public health. Relevant articles were identified through searches of four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection and BIOSIS Online) for studies published before March 2014, as well as through reviewing references of published articles. A total of six studies published from 1992 to 2010 were included in this review. Overall, findings were inconsistent. Three studies reported statistically significant associations of CSA with PTB (<37 weeks gestation) or shorter mean gestational age at birth. Women with a history of CSA had 2.6 to 4.8-fold increased odds of PTB as compared with women without a history of CSA. Three other studies did not observe statistically significant differences in rates of PTB or mean gestational age at birth in relation to a history of CSA. Available evidence on this topic is sparse and inconsistent, and limited by a number of methodological challenges. Given the ubiquity of CSA, as well as the clinical and public health significance of PTB, more rigorously designed epidemiologic studies on the association between CSA and PTB are warranted.","published_year":2015,"pages":"174","journal":"BMC pregnancy and childbirth"},

Secondary analysis of the Perception of Disability in Mexican Population 2010 survey. Mexico. Individuals aged 60 and older with long-term disabilities without cognitive decline (N = 1,089). The elder abuse variable was constructed from the 21 questions included in the survey that assessed the presence of physical, psychological, sexual, and financial exploitation. Independent variables included demographic characteristics, self-rated health, disability (number of functional domains or basic activities), multimorbidity, emotional symptoms, health resources used, and informal help. The prevalence of elder abuse was 32.1%. The most frequent type of abuse was psychological (28.1%). Nearly 58% of respondents reported one type of abuse, 34% reported two types, and 8% reported more than three types. The most common combination of two types of abuse was psychological with financial exploitation. Variables associated with the presence of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse (conflict abuse) were age 80 and older, 9 or more years of education, unemployment, negative self-rated health, three or more disabilities, emotional symptoms, and history of hospitalization. Financial exploitation was associated with age 80 and older, being married or living with a partner, 9 or more years of education, unemployment, living in an urban area, negative self-rated health, three or more disabilities, emotional symptoms, and history of hospitalization. The prevalence of abuse in elderly Mexican adults with long-term disabilities is high. Associated factors were level of education, number of disabilities, and health status. Further studies should explore the applicability of these results to other populations.","published_year":2015,"pages":"1594-600","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society"},

This is a prospective, observational study of 240 consecutive HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. All patients underwent 2 sequential chest computed tomographic scans to assess the change in coronary artery calcium (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and EAT volume. Patients with known cardiovascular disease were excluded. Factors independently associated with EAT change were explored using multivariable linear regression analyses. The association between EAT increase and CAC progression was explored using logistic regression analyses. Two hundred forty patients were included. Patients' mean age was 47.5 ± 8 years, and 68% were men. The median interval between computed tomographic scans was 18.7 months (interquartile range 10-27 months). Men showed a larger increase in EAT (5 ± 14.2 cm(3)) than did women (-0.45 ± 8.8 cm(3), P = .007). Factors independently associated with change in EAT were CD4(+) recovery (β = 0.43, CI 0.05-0.82) and male gender (β = 5.65, CI, 1.05-10.26). Change in EAT was independently associated with CAC progression (odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.004-1.88, P = .030) after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In this cohort of patients with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, male gender and CD4(+) were independent predictors of EAT increase, and there was a parallel progression of CAC and EAT.

Prophylactic 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHP-C) reduces the risk of preterm birth in some women who are at risk for preterm birth. We sought to test whether 17OHP-C would prolong pregnancy or improve perinatal outcome when given to mothers with preterm rupture of the membranes. This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The study included singleton pregnancies with gestational ages from 23(0/7) to 30(6/7) weeks at enrollment, documented PROM, and no contraindication to expectant management. Consenting women were assigned randomly to receive weekly intramuscular injections of 17OHP-C (250 mg) or placebo. The primary outcome was continuation of pregnancy until a favorable gestational age, which was defined as either 34(0/7) weeks of gestation or documentation of fetal lung maturity at 32(0/7) to 33(6/7) weeks of gestation. The 2 prespecified secondary outcomes were interval from randomization to delivery and composite adverse perinatal outcome. The planned sample size was 222 total women. From October 2011 to April 2014, 152 women were enrolled; 74 women were allocated randomly to 17OHP-C, and 78 were allocated randomly to placebo. The trial was stopped when results of a planned interim analysis suggested that continuation was futile. The primary outcome was achieved in 3% of the 17OHP-C group and 8% of the placebo group (P = .18).

The age, gender, previous experience, opinions and personality traits of participants were explored. The results showed that 118 (79 per cent) thought they should be involved in helping staff improve hand hygiene and that extraversion was the only personality trait with a significant association with this tendency of wanting to be involved. Age was a significant factor in how likely participants were to ask different groups of staff and how they would feel about asking, with older people being more reluctant. Participants valued measures that facilitated them asking - staff wearing badges was the most popular of these.Groups of patients in this and other studies (National Patient Safety Agency, 2004) indicate that patients want to be involved in helping to improve hand hygiene. In practice, we need to acknowledge the complex nature of involving individuals in challenging staff to improve their own care, and also that hand hygiene is ultimately the responsibility of health professionals.","published_year":2005,"pages":"26-30 5p","journal":"British Journal of Infection Control"},

Our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness of a multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) for predicting mortality risk in older patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: This prospective study included 134 hospitalized patients aged 65 and older with a diagnosis of CAP. A standardized CGA that included information on clinical, cognitive, functional, and nutritional status as well as comorbidities, medications, and social support network was used to calculate MPI. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) was also calculated. The predictive value of the MPI for all cause mortality over a 1-year follow-up was evaluated and was compared with that of PSI. RESULTS: Higher MPI values were significantly associated with higher mortality at 30 days (Grade 1 = 3%, Grade 2 = 12%, Grade 3 = 44%, p < .001), 6 months (Grade 1 = 7%, Grade 2 = 21%, Grade 3 = 50%, p < .001), and 1 year (Grade 1 = 10%, Grade 2 = 33%, Grade 3 = 53%, p < .001). A close agreement was found between the estimated mortality by MPI and the observed mortality. MPI had a significant greater discriminatory power than PSI both at 30 days (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.83 vs 0.71, p = .019) and 6 months (0.79 vs 0.69, p = .035), but not after 1 year of follow-up (0.80 vs 0.75, p = .185). CONCLUSIONS: This MPI, calculated from information collected in a standardized CGA, accurately stratifies hospitalized elderly patients with CAP into groups at varying risk of short- and long-term mortality. The predictive accuracy of the MPI was higher than the predictive value of the PSI.","published_year":2009,"pages":"880-7","journal":"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci"},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients in the United States (n = 23,105) and 14 other countries (n = 17,916) were randomized to receive streptokinase plus either subcutaneous or intravenous (IV) heparin, accelerated recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) plus IV heparin, or combined streptokinase and rt-PA plus IV heparin. OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in 30-day mortality and patient management were compared among treatments and between US and non-US patients. Treatment-by-country interactions were assessed by logistic regression analyses. Expected mortality of US and non-US patients was estimated using a predictive model and was compared with observed mortality. RESULTS: Mortality reduction with accelerated rt-PA vs streptokinase was greater in the United States (1.2% absolute decrease vs 0.7% elsewhere), but the test for treatment-by-country interaction against streptokinase was not significant (P = .30). Benefits of accelerated rt-PA over combination therapy were observed in the United States, but not in other countries (P = .02). Despite differences in base-line characteristics and patient management, 30-day mortality was not significantly different: 6.8% in the United States vs 7.2% elsewhere (P = .09). After adjustment for baseline differences, observed vs predicted outcomes were slightly better in the United States (6.8% vs 7.0%) than elsewhere (7.2% vs 7.0%), indicating that enrollment in the United States was a marginally significant predictor of better survival (P = .047). CONCLUSIONS: No significant evidence for a differentially greater benefit of accelerated rt-PA over streptokinase was found in US vs non-US patients. However, increased procedure and treatment use in the United States was associated with only a small decrease in short-term mortality. Long-term follow-up is required to clarify the relationship between survival and the more intensive US management approach.","published_year":1995,"pages":"1586-91","journal":"Jama"},

Such methods call for the adoption of robust sample storage and transport formats for small volumes of biofluids. One such format is the dried biofluid spot, which combines small volume requirements with easy portability. Here, we describe ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomics of dried rodent serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid spots. An in-vial extraction and UHPLC-MS analysis method was first developed and validated by fingerprinting two test fluids, rat serum and RPMI cell nutrient medium. Data for these extracts were compared in terms of (i) peak area measurements of selected features to assess reproducibility and (ii) total fingerprint variation after data pretreatment. Results showed that percentage peak area variation was found to range between 1.4 and 9.4% relative standard deviation (RSD) for a representative set of molecular features. Upon application of the method to spots bearing serum, urine or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from healthy rats and mice, a total of 1,182 and 2,309 reproducible molecular features were obtained in positive and negative ionization modes, respectively, of which 610 (positive) and 991 (negative) were found in both rats and mice. Feature matching was used to detect similarities and differences between biofluids, with the biggest overlap found between fingerprints obtained in urine and CSF. Our results thus demonstrate the potential of such direct fingerprinting of dried biofluid spots as a viable alternative to the use of small (10-15 muL) volumes of neat biofluids in animal studies.","published_year":2013,"pages":"7257-63","journal":"Anal Chem"},

Five patients in whom traditional, conservative treatment modalities did not work underwent a variety of muscle flap closures with successful healing. OBJECTIVES: Patients with complicated back wounds ranging from exposed hardware to post-traumatic defects were treated initially with conservative treatments. The authors evaluated the efficacy of applying techniques and knowledge gained from complex lower extremity wound coverage of back wounds. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Six muscle transfer procedures were performed on five patients. All patients were closed with local muscle flaps using the trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscles. METHODS: Success was defined as a closed stable wound that needed no future surgery nor allowed the primary defect to heal before hardware removal. There was no evidence of chronic infection. Surgical hardware was salvaged in one of three patients. RESULTS: All were successfully closed and have been followed up to 30 months without evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The cases presented illustrate the usefulness of rotation flaps when there is an extensive soft tissue defect that has exposed neural, osseous, and foreign structures. The use of local transposition muscle flaps as an adjunct in closing complex back wounds has been very successful in our experience. Although recurrent infection may occur, this technique has facilitated the establishment of a soft tissue envelope to achieve short- and long-term wound healing.","published_year":1994,"pages":"1467-70","journal":"Spine (Phila Pa 1976)"},

We compared neonatal outcomes among women with different IPIs between their mifepristone-induced abortion and subsequent pregnancy. Results: When compared to IPI of 18-24 months, there was an increased risk of the neonate being small for gestational age (SGA) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-3.88] when IPI was < 6 months; this risk was greater among women without a curettage history after abortion (aOR: 2.49; 95% CI: 1.13-5.50).

Food and tap water are likely sources of environmental exposure to perchlorate. The aim of this study was to identify significant dietary sources of perchlorate using perchlorate measured in urine as an exposure indicator. Sample-weighted, age-stratified linear regression models of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2008 data (n = 16,955 participants) characterized the association between urinary perchlorate and the mass consumed in USDA food groups, controlling for urinary creatinine and other potential confounders. Separate models of NHANES 2005-2006 data (n = 2841) evaluated the association between urinary perchlorate and perchlorate consumed via residential tap water. Consumption of milk products was associated with statistically significant contributions to urinary perchlorate across all age strata: 2.93 ng CIO4-/m1 per kg consumed for children (6-11 years-old (YO)); 1.54 ng CIO4-/ml per kg for adolescents (12-19 YO); and 0.69 ng CIO4-/m1 per kg for adults (20-84 YO). Vegetables were a significant contributor for adolescents and adults, whereas fruits and eggs contributed significantly only for adults. Dark-green leafy vegetables contributed the most among all age strata: 30.83 ng CIO4-/ml per kg for adults. Fats, oils, and salad dressings were significant contributors only for children. Three food groups were negatively associated with urinary perchlorate: grain products for children; sugars, sweets, and beverages for adolescents; and home tap water for adults.

A structured search yielded 16 grants with varying definitions of \"follow-up\" (e.g., completion of recommended tests, time to diagnosis); most included minority racial/ethnic group participants. Ten grants concentrated on measurement/intervention development and 13 piloted or tested interventions (categories not mutually exclusive). All studies considered patient-level factors and effects. Although some directed interventions at provider levels, few measured group characteristics and effects of interventions on the providers or levels other than the patient. Multilevel interventions are being proposed, but clarity about endpoints, definition of levels, and measures is needed.

Material and methods: Nineteen consecutive adult patients (range 43-83 years) underwent hemiarthroplasty as definitive treatment for 20 displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures after having received 500mg of tetracycline hydrochloride orally every six hours for the immediate five preoperative days. Humeral head biopsies were taken from four pre-determined locations intraoperatively. The biopsies were prepared and analyzed with fluorescent microscopy. Results: All specimens in each biopsy location demonstrated fluorescence. There was no difference between the mean rank gray values for the four biopsy locations (p = 0.78 with the Friedman test).

Fas receptor-deficient (lpr) and C57BL/6 mice were treated with APAP to compare the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Lpr mice were partially protected against APAP hepatotoxicity as indicated by reduced plasma ALT and GDH levels and liver necrosis. Hepatic Cyp2e1 protein, adduct formation and hepatic glutathione (GSH) depletion were similar, demonstrating equivalent reactive metabolite generation. There was no difference in cytokine formation or hepatic neutrophil recruitment. Interestingly, hepatic GSH recovered faster in lpr mice than in wild type animals resulting in enhanced detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Driving the increased GSH levels, mRNA induction and protein expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase (gclc) were higher in lpr mice. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein levels at 6 h were significantly lower in lpr mice, which correlated with reduced nitrotyrosine staining. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mRNA levels were substantially higher in lpr mice after APAP. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the faster recovery of hepatic GSH levels during oxidant stress and peroxynitrite formation, reduced iNOS expression and enhanced induction of Hsp70 attenuated the susceptibility to APAP-induced cell death in lpr mice.

Our institution was a trial site for the investigational device exemption (IDE) for 2 of the 3 stentless valve bioprostheses and has clinical experience in all 3 valves that are soon to be available. From July 1996 to January 2001, we have implanted 213 porcine stentless valves: the Toronto SPV (159), the Freestyle (20), and the Prima Plus (34) (current IDE). Fifty-five percent of these patients had concomitant coronary artery bypass graft procedures, 44% had isolated aortic valve replacements, and 3 patients required aortic valve and mitral valve procedures. Fifty-nine percent of the patients were men, 9% of procedures were reoperations, and 22% of patients were in New York Heart Association classification III or IV preoperatively. Extubation occurred within 5 hours for 52% of patients, median cardiothoracic intensive care unit length of stay was 1 day, and postoperative length of stay was 6 days. Reoperations for bleeding occurred in 5.3% of patients (0 in the past 12 months), atrial fibrillation in 28.2%, and permanent neurologic deficit in 1.9%. No patients required valve-related reoperations or had either sepsis or sternal infections. Operative mortality was 1.4%. We have also analyzed a subset of patients who had minimally invasive aortic valve replacement versus the standard approach and found no important differences in mortality (none), postoperative complications, cardiopulmonary bypass, or cross-clamp times. There was a trend towards earlier ambulation, less atrial fibrillation (15.8% v 24.1%), and earlier hospital discharge (5.6 days v 7.2 days).

Of the 677 results obtained, 21 studies were included in the systematic review. The CONSORT checklist was used to review study quality. 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences were computed for each study outcome and effect size estimates were aggregated using random- effects models with Comprehensive Metaanalysis Version 2 software. RESULTS: When the effect size estimates of 11 stress management interventions on NK cell outcomes were aggregated, the overall effect size estimate was 0.23 and was significant (p < 0.05). There was an overall effect size of 0.037 for CD4 (based on 6 studies), and this effect was not significant (p = 0.75). The composite effect size estimate was -0.11 for CD8 (based on 6 studies) and was not significant (p = 0.32). Heterogeneity Q statistic was not significant in any of the analyses and funnel plots appeared to be symmetrical in all analyses, suggesting a common population of studies and lack of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Stress management interventions in breast cancer patients appears to improve NK cell outcomes shortly after the intervention, but not influence T-lymphocyte CD4 and CD8 counts. The systematic review indicates that interventions focusing on autogenic training, meditation, and/or selfreflection tended to have a larger impact on improved NK cell outcomes than traditional cognitive- behavioral therapy. This finding is important because research has shown that decreased numbers or function of NK cells is related to increased metastasis. Conversely, increased NK function has been found to lead to cancer regression. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The effects of stress management intervention on short term NK cell outcomes in breast cancer patients may be explained by their effects on immunomodulators such as glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) and/or cytokines (e.g., Interleukin-2). Additional research is warranted. Although physiologically plausible, results should be interpreted with caution. The small number of studies, combination of NK cell outcomes of count and function, heterogeneity of the interventions, and differences in patient treatments may also be influencing these findings. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The impact of stress reduction interventions in breast cancer likely varies depending on the specific tumor and patient factors. Despite this heterogeneity, stress management appears to improve NK cell outcomes in the short term (at the end of the intervention). It is less clear whether these changes are longer-lasting, if continued practice or booster sessions may help maintain these improvements, or if such improvements result in associated enhanced physical health outcomes in breast cancer patients.","published_year":2014,"pages":"124","journal":"Psycho-Oncology"},

M.","Ogollah, R.","Vogel, S.","Hay, E. M."],"abstract":"Background: Patients with back pain radiating to the leg(s) report worse symptoms and poorer recovery than those with back pain alone. Robust evidence regarding their epidemiological profile is lacking from primary care, the setting where most of these patients will present and be managed. Our objective was to describe the characteristics of patients with back and leg pain, including sciatica, seeking treatment in primary care. Methods: Adults visiting their general practitioner with back and leg pain, of any duration and severity, were invited to participate. Participants completed questionnaires, underwent clinical assessments and received MRI scans. Characteristics of the sample are described, and differences between patients diagnosed with referred leg pain and those with sciatica are analysed. Results: Six hundred nine patients participated; 62.6 % were female, mean (SD) age 50.2 (13.9). 67.5 % reported pain below the knee, 60.7 % were in paid employment with 39.7 % reporting time off work. Mean disability (RMDQ) was 12.7 (5.7) and mean pain intensity was 5.6 (2.2) and 5.2 (2.4) for back and leg respectively. Mean sciatica bothersomeness index (SBI) was 14.9 (5.1). Three quarters (74.2 %) were clinically diagnosed as having sciatica. In the sciatica group, leg pain intensity, neuropathic pain, pain below the knee, leg pain worse than back pain, SBI and positive MRI findings were significantly higher as compared to patients with referred leg pain. Conclusions: This primary care cohort reported high levels of disability and pain. This is the first epidemiological study of unselected primary care patients seeking healthcare for back and leg pain. Follow-up of this cohort will investigate the prognostic value of their baseline characteristics. This new information will contribute to our understanding of the characteristics and clinical features of this population, and will underpin future research aimed at defining prognostic subgroups to enable better targeting of health care provision.","published_year":2015,"pages":"","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders"},

The relationship between cephalosporin hypersensitivity and history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity is not clear. This retrospective study is to evaluate the reliability of routine prophylactic skin test with cefazolin in general population and the relationship between results of cefazolin skin testing and the history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity. Methods: The medical records of patientswho underwent skin testing to cefazolinfrom January 2010 to January 2011 at Bundang Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea were evaluated. Cefazolin was injected intradermaly with the concentration of 0.3 mg/ml without negative control. Skin testing to negative control was done for some of the patients who showed the positive results in cefazolin skin testing. History of beta-lactam hypersensitivity is taken from the statements of patients. Immediate adverse reactions after cefazolin injection were evaluated by searching key words including urticaria, itching, hypersensitivity, or anaphylaxis within 3 days after start of cefazolin in electronic chart and searching the consultations to allergy specialists or dermatologists after cefazolin injection. And then the medical records of searched patients were reviewed by an allergist. Results: There were 13,153 cases of skin testing with cefazolin during 13 months. Positive rate of cefazolin skin tests without negative and positive controls was 1.4%. Among 81 patients with history of suspicious beta-lactam hypersensitivity, 7 patients (9.9%) had positive results, as compared with 176 patients (1.3%) of patients without suchhistory (9.9% vs 1.3%, P < 0.0001). Among 19 patients who showed positive skin testing to cefazolin and then tested with negative control, 14 (73.4%) patients were proved as false positive with reactivity to normal saline. Among 1,152 patientsexamined for skin testing to cefazolin more than twice during 13 months, 21 patients (1.8%) showed different results in serial skin tests to cefazolin. Conclusions: This study suggests that routine prophylactic skin testing to cefazolin without negative control for all patients seems unreliable but prophylactic testing for patients with the history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity could be helpful, although the large prospective study is needed.","published_year":2013,"pages":null,"journal":"World Allergy Organization Journal"},

Existing models of cultural evolution, inspired by models of genetic evolution, lend support to the former and do not generate trajectories that include large-scale punctuated change. We propose a simple model that can give rise to both exponential and punctuated patterns of gain and loss of cultural traits. In it, cultural innovation comprises several realistic interdependent processes that occur at different rates. The model also takes into account two properties intrinsic to cultural evolution: the differential distribution of traits among social groups and the impact of environmental change. In our model, a population may be subdivided into groups with different cultural repertoires leading to increased susceptibility to cultural loss, whereas environmental change may lead to rapid loss of traits that are not useful in a new environment. Taken together, our results suggest the usefulness of a concept of an effective cultural population size.","published_year":2015,"pages":"E6762-9","journal":""},

 {"title":"The Information Age, Cyberspace, and Cancer","authors":["Ambinder, Edward P. M. D."],"abstract":"The National Cancer Policy Forum of the Institute of Medicine workshop entitled \"A Foundation for EvidenceDriven Practice: A Rapid Learning System for Cancer Care\"[ll] examined the elements of a rapid learning system for cancer. It recommended that the elements of such a system include: registries and databases, emerging information technology, tools for patientcentered and patient-driven clinical decision support and patient engagement, ways of accommodating culture change, clinical practice guidelines, point-of-care needs in clinical oncology, and federal policy issues and implications. ASCO and others have begun to define a Rapid Learning System for Cancer. [12] It will use the tools of the Information Age to develop a more thorough understanding of cancer biology, defining a cancer based on a molecularly-driven diagnosis; it will also incorporate a therapeutic development system that uses oncology EHR registries to produce smarter and faster clinical trials. Because of its more seamless integration of clinical and translational research, it has the potential to ensure that every cancer patients experience can inform research and improve care and help us take full advantage of the wonders of the Information Age and cyberspace. [13] There are three major standardized features of health information technology. First is the common data element that defines the data to be collected in the medical record and the specific identifying label of each data field. It includes the clinical vocabularies used to describe the clinical encounter (eg, SNOMED-CT) and the laboratory data (eg, LOINC), terms describing basic and clinical research activities (eg, cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid [caBIG]), and elements and codes that define specific disease classifications used for mostly billing and registry purposes (eg, ICD-9 and ICD-IO codes). Next are the software functionalities that refer to what tools and capabilities a software program should have. Finally, there is interoperability, which defines how the data created in one EHR can be sent to another EHR with full understanding of their meaning so that they will be placed in the appropriate data fields of the receiving program. ASCO, through its Health Information Technology Working Group, of which I am a member, and the National Cancer Institutes caBIG and Community Cancer Center Program created the Clinical Oncology Requirements for the EHR (CORE) that delineated the core common data elements, functionalities, and interoperability standards that have helped define oncology EHR certification criteria used by the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) and that will guide future software design for the oncology community. [6] Today, general-purpose Windows and Mac OS X computers are the machines most commonly used for EHRs. These computers can do hundreds of thousands of different things, sometimes all at the same time, although users of non-Mac computers pay for this capability with instability, performance degradation, viruses, and steep learning curves. These computers can do pretty much anything, but they carry the burden of 30 years of rapid, unplanned change. Many physicians are frustrated with a lot of the existing EHR software choices that rely on the existing PC and Mac paradigm that uses windows, icons, menus, and pointers (WIMP) for human -computer interaction. This older technology requires huge initial costs ($88,000 to $100,000 per physician for EHR startup expenses), is difficult to navigate (through the different parts of the program), and lacks interoperability. It requires indeterminate training periods, impedes office workflows, is frequently abandoned (20% or higher abandonment rates), and has poor learning recall without constant use. Since most programs are proprietary, a practice is locked into the tool sets of the purchased program and is unable to substitute an easier and better software tool when it comes along. Customization is cumbersome, and huge expenses are incurred if one wants t interface the EHR with other medical software. In addition, existing EHRs do a poor job of providing meaningful and sophisticated decision support tools, electronic guidelines and technology assessment tools, authoring and customization tools, easily customized report writers, point-of-service links to educational resources for physicians or patients, seamless communication and messaging services between health care stake holders, and coordination of care capabilities.","published_year":2012,"pages":"324-7","journal":"Oncology"},
 {"title":"Evaluation of human secretoglobins and MIC-1 as serum diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer","authors":["Bistrup, A.","Cabaltica, C.","Jalilie, M.","Wolfert, R. L.","Kim, N. W."],"abstract":"Using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found mRNA corresponding to several members of the human secretoglobin family and MIC-1 to be highly expressed in various cancer tissues, as compared to the corresponding normal tissues. Our target ECM2, known in the literature as Lipophilin B (LipB), was found to be upregulated in endometrial, uterine, breast and prostate cancer tissues. Our target ECM3, also known as Mammaglobin B (MamB) or Lipophilin C, was found to be upregulated in endometrial and uterine cancer tissues. DD-X065, also known in the literature as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) family, was found to be upregulated in breast, colon, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer tissues. There is considerable evidence suggesting that members of the secretoglobin family exist predominantly as heterodimers and higher order complexes. Mammaglobin A (MamA) protein has been found to be present in breast tissue in a complex with LipB protein. We generated a series of mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against different complexes composed of members of the family, including MamA, LipB, and MamB. Employing these specific antibodies, we have developed sensitive immunoassays to measure serum levels of several of the complexes. In the current study, we evaluated serum from breast cancer patients for levels of two secretoglobin family complexes: MamA/LipB and MamB/LipB, as well as for MIC-1, utilizing our previously established ELISA assay<sup>2</sup>. The study comprised serum samples from 150 normal healthy individuals and 250 breast cancer patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the assays for detection of breast cancer were quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Compared to normal healthy individuals, the median serum concentrations of MamA/LipB was increased by approximately 2.8 fold in breast cancer, irrespective of stage. ROC analysis of breast cancer patients versus normal healthy individuals resulted in an AUC of 0.67 in all stages. For MamB/LipB, the median serum concentration in cancer serum was increased over normals by approximately 1.8 fold and the corresponding AUC was 0.62. The median serum concentration for MIC-1 in cancer serum was increased over normals by approximately 1.1 fold and the corresponding AUC was 0.61. The sensitivity of the MIC-1 assay was greater than that of any of the secretoglobin family complex assays at 90%, 95% and 98%. Our study suggests that MIC-1 and members of the secretoglobin family may be promising serum markers for breast cancer. Their utility may be improved when used in combination with other novel diagnostic biomarkers. Further studies are underway to validate the clinical potential of this family of markers.","published_year":2009,"pages":"31st Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium San Antonio, TX United States.

J.","Lloyd, A.","Wakefield, D."],"abstract":"Purpose. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a major role in connective tissue remodelling, wound healing and embryogenesis. They have also been implicated in pathological tissue degradation in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and tumor invasion. The aim of this study was to define the potential role of MMPs in the inflammatory process of uveitis by identifying these proteases in the aqueous humor (AH) of patients with uveitis and in rabbits with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). Methods. Aqueous humor samples from 6 patients with uveitis and 5 control patients who had undergone elective cataract surgery were examined. The profile of MMPs in the AH of experimentally-induced acute anterior uveitis in rabbits was also assessed. Western blot analysis and SDS-PAGE substrate zymography were used to detect metalloenzymes and their natural inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) in aqueous samples. Results. Aqueous humor from all patient contained interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), stromelysin (MMP-3), gelatinase B (MMP-9) and TIMP-1. Although the amount of MMPs varied considerably, TIMP-1 levels remained unchanged in the aqueous of uveitis patients. Using substrate gel zymography, we were able to reveal several gelatinolytic bands, including one major band at approximately 92-kDa whose activity differed between uveitis and cataract AH. The gelatinase activity found in human AH samples was shown to be inhibited by 10mM EDTA and activated in vitro by APMA, indicating that these enzymes were indeed of the metalloproteinase class. Aqueous humor samples from the rabbit EIU model revealed a 100-kDa molecular weight species likely to correspond to gelatinase B. This gelatinolytic activity was maximal at 6 hours after the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, declined at 12 and 24 hours post LPS, and was absent at later time points. The induction of gelatinase activity in rabbit AH preceded the increase in cell number during the inflammatory process in the anterior chamber. Conclusions. Metalloproteinases found in normal human AH may participate in physiological turnover of extracellular matrix in the eye. Elevated levels of MMPs were found in the AH of patients with uveal inflammation and animals with LPS-induced uveitis, where they are likely to be critical to tissue destructive and repair processes. It is likely that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), which are known modulators of MMPs, induce their secretion in acute anterior uveitis.","published_year":1996,"pages":"1060-1068","journal":"Current Eye Research"},

It is affecting approximately up to 14% of all pregnancies with an increasing tendency. GDM has been related to relevant short-term and long-term health complications for both mother and offspring. Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of obesity and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in d-AAs in biological fluids. As d-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free d-AAs ratio in a GDM study.Only 1. mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500. mg/3. mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-. l-Val N-propionyl-. l-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25. m. ×. 0.25. mm I.D., 0.12. μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/. z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of d-and l-AAs were separated.The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized.The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for d-Ala, d-Pro, d-Ser, d-Met, d-Phe, d-Glu, d-Orn and d-Lys. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra.Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %. d-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, Val, Thr, Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, Phe, Tyr, Orn and Lys. Statistically significant differences (. p<. 0.05) were observed only for d-Phe and higher values were found in the GDM group. It is possible that d-Phe could be involved in metabolic/signaling pathways to compensate early stages of insulin resistance, although further work is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.","published_year":2015,"pages":"480-487","journal":""},

Common complications include postoperative infections, cardiopulmonary complications, and bleeding episodes. Preoperative abstinence may to some degree reverse alcohol-induced pathophysiological processes and thus prevent postoperative complications.Objectives: To assess the effect of preoperative alcohol cessation interventions on the rate of postoperative complications including mortality in hazardous drinkers. To assess the effect of preoperative alcohol cessation interventions for hazardous drinkers on alcohol use in the postoperative period and in the long term.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to September 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1966 to September 2011); CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1982 to September 2011). We combined the MEDLINE search strategy with the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy, as contained in the Cochrane Handbook for SystematicÂ Reviews of Interventions, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Selection criteria: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of a preoperative alcohol cessation intervention on postoperative complications or postoperative alcohol consumption, or both, in the short and long term in hazardous drinkers . We excluded intraoperative and postoperative alcohol interventions.Data collection and analysis: Three authors independently assessed studies to determine eligibility and extracted data using a tool based on guidance in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Where required, we obtained additional information through collaboration with the original author. We presented the main outcomes as dichotomous variables. Where data were available, we planned to conduct subgroup analyses as well as a sensitivity analysis to explore risk of bias.Main results: We included two studies which involved 69 patients. Both studies were RCTs evaluating the effect of intensive alcohol cessation interventions including pharmacological strategies for alcohol withdrawal and relapse prophylaxis.Our primary outcome measure was postoperative complications and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Meta-analysis showed an effect on the overall complication rates (odds ratio (OR) 0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.61; P = 0.004). There was no significant reduction of in-hospital and 30-day mortality (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.06 to 2.83; P = 0.35).Secondary outcomes included length of stay and postoperative alcohol use. No significant reduction was found.Authors' conclusions: Based on the finding of two studies, it appears that intensive preoperative alcohol cessation interventions, including pharmacological strategies for relapse prophylaxis and withdrawal symptoms, may significantly reduce postoperative complication rates. No effect was found on mortality rates and length of stay.The effect of preoperative alcohol cessation intervention should be further explored in an effort to reduce the adverse effect of alcohol use on surgical outcomes. The number needed to screen to identify eligible patients for alcohol intervention studies in surgical settings seems to be extremely high.

 {"title":"[Treatment by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction. What did the clinical trials teach us?].","authors":["Guéret P.","Garot J.","Barnier P."],"abstract":"Most clinical trials of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction have shown an improved outcome with reduction of morbidity and mortality. In comparable groups of patients, the results are concordant with a decrease in mortality which is all the more significant and early in severe infarction with serious haemodynamic consequences. The clinician has a new arm in his therapeutic arsenal either for use in the acute phase of all cases of myocardial infarction but for only a short period of 4 to 6 weeks after which the treatment is withdrawn when the anatomical sequellae are more moderate, or for use in selected cases for longer periods (patients with severe infarction with cardiac failure and/or severe left ventricular dysfunction). The second attitude has the advantage of treating a selected population which will derive greater benefits. In all cases, treatment should be started orally at low doses, and the dose must be increased rapidly do attain the target dosage under close clinical and biological surveillance. When the classical contraindications are respected, ACE inhibitors seem to be well tolerated even at the relatively high dosages recommended after myocardial infarction. Hypotension and, more rarely, renal failure, are the two most common complications leading to withdrawal of treatment, but neither of these side effects was associated with increased mortality in any of the clinical trials. The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors exert these beneficial effects after myocardial infarction are not only their haemodynamic effects and their role in ventricular remodelling, but also probably by a vascular protective action which, if confirmed, would further increase the indications of this therapeutic class in cardiovascular diseases.","published_year":1996,"pages":"33-8","journal":"Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux"},

B-cell activating factor (BAFF) modulates cell growth and survival in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. However, there are few studies of EBV, BAFF/BAFF-R signaling, and NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 pathway activation in PTLD. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) in two different clinical contexts, immunocompetent patients (DLBCL/IC; n = 30) or posttransplantation solid-organ recipients (DLBCL/PTLD; n = 21), were characterized histogenically as germinal center (GC) or non-germinal center (NGC). Expression of BAFF, BAFF-R, and NF-κB proteins p50 and p52 and the presence or absence of EBV were compared in these clinical contexts. Regardless of the GC or NGC pattern of DLBCL, BAFF-R was expressed in 37% of DLBCL/IC but in only 4.8% of DLBCL/PTLD. p52 was expressed in DLBCL/PTLD/NGC (12 of 19 cases) as compared with DLBCL/IC/NGC (0 of 18 cases). This pattern might be related to the presence of EBV and latent membrane protein 1 because p52 expression was observed primarily in EBV-positive DLBCL/PTLD cases expressing latent membrane protein 1. Thus, the activation profile or NGC pattern of DLBCL/PTLD was not associated with BAFF/BAFF-R expression, whereas nuclear p52 related to NF-κB2 pathway activation might be linked to EBV.","published_year":2011,"pages":"1630-7","journal":"The American journal of pathology"},

 {"title":"Unenhanced CT and acute stroke physiology","authors":["Kucinski, T."],"abstract":"Early ischemic edema develops only in regions with an initially severe reduction in blood flow. The presence of ischemic hypodensity on admission-unenhanced CT typically indicates irreversible infarction [25,36,96], and, in the 3 to 6 hour time range for the ECASS trials, the size of that hypodensity is an important risk factor for symptomatic hemorrhage after thrombolysis [34,52]. In NINDS patients, however, in the 0 to 3 hour range, there was a lack of prognostic significance for EIS > the MCA territory [55]. In the angiographically controlled PROACT II study [27,50], there was no relevance of EIS for predicting symptomatic hemorrhage [97]. Regardless of their implications for forecasting clinical outcome, EIS remain the simplest, most available, and most specific indicators of definite brain infarction, and hence their recognition is important for acute stroke evaluation. Rapid, accurate quantification of EIS on unenhanced CT remains a major challenge for neuroradiologists and stroke physicians. Standardization of the \"one third rule\", with a more detailed checklist of suspected EIS locations as accomplished with ASPECTS [38], may help readers detect these sites of early, irreversible edema. If clearly marginated hypodensity is present in suspected early stroke victims, the time window from onset must be carefully checked because an HU decrease of more than 4 to 6 HU may not be apparent within the first 6 hours of onset. After hemorrhage, the visualization of EIE on CT or MR imaging is the next and most important task in current acute stroke imaging. Other important variables, such as site and degree of occlusion and core/penumbra mismatch, can be accomplished with multimodal CT [98] or MR imaging [99,100]; these data may prove to be critical as the next generation of acute stroke treatments becomes available. The insights regarding acute stroke physiology provided by studying the CT evolution of early ischemic signs continue to be valuable for informed interpretation of all stroke images. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of their recently completed genomes confirmed the presence of non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposons, also called retroposons. Using the 79-bp signature sequence common to all trypanosomatid retroposons as bait, we identified in the Leishmania major genome two new large families of small elements--LmSIDER1 (785 copies) and LmSIDER2 (1,073 copies)--that fulfill all the characteristics of extinct trypanosomatid retroposons. LmSIDERs are approximately 70 times more abundant in L. major compared to T. brucei and are found almost exclusively within the 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of L. major mRNAs. We provide experimental evidence that LmSIDER2 act as mRNA instability elements and that LmSIDER2-containing mRNAs are generally expressed at lower levels compared to the non-LmSIDER2 mRNAs. The considerable expansion of LmSIDERs within 3'UTRs in an organism lacking transcriptional control and their role in regulating mRNA stability indicate that Leishmania have probably recycled these short retroposons to globally modulate the expression of a number of genes. To our knowledge, this is the first example in eukaryotes of the domestication and expansion of a family of mobile elements that have evolved to fulfill a critical cellular function.","published_year":2007,"pages":"1291-307","journal":"PLoS pathogens"},

Further analysis of real-world data for OA provides additional evidence in support of pharmacological interventions, in terms of management of OA pain and function, avoidance of adverse events, disease-modifying effects and long-term outcomes, e.g., delay of total joint replacement surgery, and pharmacoeconomic factors such as reduction in healthcare resource utilization. This article provides an updated assessment of the literature for selected interventions in OA, focusing on real-life data, with the aim of providing easy-to-follow advice on how to establish a treatment flow in patients with knee OA in primary care clinical practice, in support of the clinicians' individualized assessment of the patient. In step 1, background maintenance therapy with symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) is recommended, for which high-quality evidence is provided only for the prescription formulations of patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Paracetamol may be added for rescue analgesia only, due to limited efficacy and increasing safety signals. Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may provide additional symptomatic treatment with the same degree of efficacy as oral NSAIDs without the systemic safety concerns. Oral NSAIDs maintain a central role in step 2 advanced management of persistent symptoms. However, oral NSAIDs are highly heterogeneous in terms of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety profile, and patient stratification with careful treatment selection is advocated to maximize the risk:benefit ratio. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid as a next step provides sustained clinical benefit with effects lasting up to 6 months after a short-course of weekly injections. As a last step before surgery, the slow titration of sustained-release tramadol, a weak opioid, affords sustained analgesia with improved tolerability. Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Treatment with antithrombotic drugs is controversial, although RVO has been surmised as a predictor of a subsequent vascular event. Aims: To evaluate risk factors, the effects of antithrombotic therapy and the occurrence of vascular events after a first episode of RVO, according to patient's age at RVO onset. Methods: Patients with central or branch RVO confirmed by fluorescein angiography were enrolled in this prospective cohort study after obtaining informed consent according to Helsinki Declaration. Common CV risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipemia, obesity, smoking), congenital and acquired thrombophilia were evaluated. Patients received anticoagulants (LMWH and warfarin) or aspirin for at least 3 months and they were followed every 6-12 months. Vascular events after RVO were recorded. Results: One-hundred patients with central RVO and 32 with branch RVO were enrolled. Five (8.3%) patients younger than 50 years and 4 (5.5%) over 50 years had a hereditary thrombophilic defect, and the difference was not significant. Antiphospholipid antibodies, hype- rhomocysteinemia, or PAI-1 increase were present in 29% of patients with no age-related differences. One or more CV risk factors were found in 35 (58%) patients of the younger group, and in 66 (91%) of the older group (P < 0.001). Antithrombotic treatment lead to both a satisfactory recanalization of occluded veins and visual acuity improvement especially in younger patients. Vascular events occurred in 19 (14%) cases after 4 ± 3.3 years from RVO; they were more frequent in older than in younger patients (22% vs. 5%, P 0.005). Conclusion: Distribution of CV, but not of other prothrombotic risk factors, seems to be influenced by age in RVO patients. Patients with a first episode of RVO, especially those older than 50 years, are likely at risk of a subsequent vascular event.","published_year":2013,"pages":"1008-1009","journal":"Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis"},

This Part 2 article discusses sensitivity and uncertainty analyses conducted to assess the key model inputs and areas of needed research for children's exposure to CCA-treated playsets and decks. The following types of analyses were conducted: (1) sensitivity analyses using a percentile scaling approach and multiple stepwise regression; and (2) uncertainty analyses using the bootstrap and two-stage Monte Carlo techniques. The five most important variables, based on both sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, were: wood surface residue-to-skin transfer efficiency; wood surface residue levels; fraction of hand surface area mouthed per mouthing event; average fraction of nonresidential outdoor time a child plays on/around CCA-treated public playsets; and frequency of hand washing. In general, there was a factor of 8 for the 5th and 95th percentiles and a factor of 4 for the 50th percentile in the uncertainty of predicted population dose estimates due to parameter uncertainty. Data were available for most of the key model inputs identified with sensitivity and uncertainty analyses; however, there were few or no data for some key inputs. To evaluate and improve the accuracy of model results, future measurement studies should obtain longitudinal time-activity diary information on children, spatial and temporal measurements of residue and soil concentrations on or near CCA-treated playsets and decks, and key exposure factors.

Important differences between early and recent studies appear to be due to the use of PCR assays based on primers located in different regions of the genome. Based on the most recent studies, the prevalence of TTV infections seems very high in the general population. TTV is present in the feces and would be transmitted through the fecal-oral route.

The relative concentration of phosphocreatine (PCr) was measured throughout the protocol and intracellular pH (pH(i)) was determined from the chemical shift between inorganic phospate (P(i)) and PCr. End-exercise PCr levels were 27 (3.4) and 25 (3.5)% of resting levels for LAP and HAP respectively. Mean resting pH(i) was 7.07 for both groups, and following exercise it fell to 6.45 (0.04) for HAP and 6.38 (0.04) for LAP. Analysis of data using non-linear regression models showed no differences in the rate of either PCr or pH(i) recovery. The results suggest that VO(2max) is a poor predictor of metabolic recovery rate from high-intensity exercise.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of randomized controlled trials published from January 1985 through May 2008. Data sources were MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases, proceedings of the 3rd International Consultation on Incontinence, and reference lists of retrieved clinical trials and review articles. Trials were eligible if they consisted of nursing home or long-term institutionalized residents with UI. Eligible trials compared interventions for improving UI with controls, including comparisons of UI outcomes and/or adverse events between randomized groups. RESULTS: Fourteen unique clinical trials, consisting of 1161 patients, met inclusion criteria. Treatments included antimuscarinic medications, oral estrogen plus progesterone, and behavioral interventions (eg, prompted voiding). Compared with usual care, prompted voiding alone or prompted voiding plus exercise reduced daytime incontinence and increased appropriate toileting. Efficacy outcomes indicated that neither prompted voiding plus exercise nor prompted voiding plus oral estrogen and progesterone was superior to prompted voiding alone for incontinence management. Prompted voiding plus oxybutynin slightly reduced incontinence compared with prompted voiding plus placebo. CONCLUSION: In nursing home residents with UI, prompted voiding alone and prompted voiding with exercise were associated with modest short-term improvement in daytime UI. Results do not clearly support an independent effect of exercise in improving UI. Oxybutynin may provide small additional benefit when used with prompted voiding. There appears to be no role for oral estrogen in UI treatment. Long-term clinical trials of prompted voiding alone, prompted voiding with exercise, and antimuscarinic medications should be conducted with targeted nursing home residents who have UI.

Non-response was categorized into Sample Mortality (that part of the original sample that died during follow-up), Sample Loss (that part of the original sample that survived but could not be found) and Refusal (that part of the original sample that survived and was found but refused to participate). Stratified analysis and adjusted multiple logistic regression modeling found sample mortality and sample loss were strongly influenced by individual and household variables and by psychopathology. Sample mortality was influenced by specific mental disorders or conditions as mania, drug abuse/dependency, antisocial personality, cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse/dependency, phobia, drug use (except PCP), and comorbidity. Household factors protective against mortality include higher household income, not living as extended members in a married couple family, and living with children in the household. Persons who were unemployed, widowed or single, without high school education, male, and 65 years of age or older were more likely to die. Sample loss was influenced by cognitive impairment, antisocial personality, and cocaine use. Household factors linked to sample loss include living in female-headed families, or non-family households, and living alone. Young nonwhite, divorced/separated, without high school education, and unemployed were also harder to find. Refusal was associated with being white, with incomplete elementary education, living as a spouse in traditional married couple families, or as a child in female-headed families. Psychopathology did not influence refusal.","published_year":1999,"pages":"91-98","journal":"Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology"},

Already several years ago increased neopterin concentrations were demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and later on in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Neopterin concentrations were found to correlate with the activity of the diseases and to conveniently indicate effects of therapy. Similar data were obtained in patients with acute rheumatic fever, and more recently, the utility of neopterin determination was also demonstrated in patients with Wegeners granulomatosis and with polymyositis/dermatomyositis. In this article we intend to summarize the current knowledge about the usefulness of neopterin measurements in patients with rheumatic diseases.","published_year":1999,"pages":"119-124","journal":"Pteridines"},
 {"title":"Endogenous angiotensin II suppresses stretch-induced ANP secretion via AT1 receptor pathway.","authors":["Oh YB.","Gao S.","Shah A.","Kim JH.","Park WH.","Kim SH."],"abstract":"Angiotensin II (Ang II) is released by stretch of cardiac myocytes and has paracrine and autocrine effects on cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. However, the direct effect of Ang II on the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is unclear. The aim of the present study is to test whether Ang II affects stretch-induced ANP secretion. The isolated perfused beating atria were used from control and two-kidney one-clip hypertensive (2K1C) rats. The volume load was achieved by elevating the height of outflow catheter connected with isolated atria from 5cmH(2)O to 7.5cmH(2)O. Atrial stretch by volume load caused increases in atrial contractility by 60% and in ANP secretion by 100%. Ang II suppressed stretch-induced ANP secretion and tended to increase atrial contractility whereas losartan stimulated stretch-induced ANP secretion. Neither PD123319 nor A779 had direct effect on stretch-induced ANP secretion. The suppressive effect of Ang II on stretch-induced ANP secretion was blocked by the pretreatment of losartan but not by the pretreatment of PD123319 or A779. In hypertrophied atria from 2K1C rats, stretch-induced ANP concentration attenuated and atrial contractility augmented. The response of stretch-induced ANP secretion to Ang II and losartan augmented. The expression of AT1 receptor protein and mRNA increased but AT2 and Mas receptor mRNA did not change in 2K1C rat atria. Therefore, we suggest that Ang II generated endogenously by atrial stretch suppresses stretch-induced ANP secretion through the AT1 receptor and alteration of Ang II effect in 2K1C rat may be due to upregulation of AT1 receptor.","published_year":2011,"pages":"374-81","journal":"Peptides"},
 {"title":"Registered nurses' attitudes toward and practices of assisted suicide and patient-requested euthanasia","authors":["Matzo, Marianne LaPorte","Caro, Francis G."],"abstract":"New England oncology nurses were surveyed regarding their attitudes and practices with respect to assisted suicide and patient-requested euthanasia. A representative sample of oncology nurses in New England was surveyed by mail to determine (1) knowledge and views of assisted suicide and patient-requested euthanasia, (2) effects of various circumstances upon the acceptability of assisted suicide and patient-requested euthanasia, and (3) actual practices at the end of their patients' lives. With a 74\\% return rate, the analysis was based upon 441 responses. Assisted suicide was defined as providing, at the patient's request, the means for them to end life; patient-requested euthanasia is the administration of medications with the intent of ending the patient's life.    Data for nurses were compared to data for a previously-surveyed random sample of New England oncology physicians (n = 180) to determine if the attitudes and practices of nurses were different from those of physicians. Bivariate analysis revealed that while sympathetic views toward end-of-life requests were widespread, physicians had more positive attitudes than nurses. While many practitioners had been exposed to these requests, more physicians had been exposed than nurses. More physicians than nurses assisted their patients' suicides (11\\% versus 1\\%); nurses were more likely than physicians to have performed patient-requested euthanasia (4\\% versus 1\\%).    A series of multivariate analyses revealed that greater religiosity (as defined by how religious the practitioners consider themselves to be and how important religious beliefs are to actions) was the most consistent predictor of favorable attitudes toward assisted suicide and patient-requested euthanasia. Neither professional role (nurse or physician) nor religious affiliation were generally associated with attitudes and practices concerning end-of-life actions. Frequency of requests and positive attitudes were positively associated with action to assist patients' deaths. Nurses frequently consulted with others (particularly physicians) about patient requests for assistance with death, but rarely with one another (including nursing supervisors). These findings show that the policy debate about professional roles in actions that end the lives of patients must be extended beyond physicians to include nurses.","published_year":1996,"pages":"204","journal":"ProQuest Dissertations and Theses"},

Therefore, in addition to culture diagnostic methods, our clinical department uses a broad-range 16S and 18S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing test to detect and identify IE agents. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, we performed 246 valve replacements due to endocarditis. In 46 patients with culture-negative IE or incongruent preoperative microbiological diagnostics, heart valve (HV) samples were PCR-analysed and PCR products subsequently sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The molecular diagnosis led us to change the antibiotic regimen in 7 of 46 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The PCR results demonstrate that the molecular test is a useful diagnostic tool for the rapid diagnosis of IE. Furthermore, the molecular diagnosis had a significant, direct impact on the therapy of IE. This suggests that using PCR can improve antibiotic treatment, particularly in cases of culture-negative IE. Consequently, molecular analysis of micro-organisms in HV samples should be performed routinely where preoperative diagnosis remains unclear.","published_year":2015,"pages":"589-93","journal":"Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery"},

We discuss the literature on beliefs and views of the Chinese community resident in Western countries, drawing especially on the UK. A critical evaluation of the literature is presented to encourage and facilitate additional research on end-of-life issues for Chinese people. Following detailed description of key contributing factors and issues for Chinese people facing death, the paper highlights four important aspects of research in this area: diagnostic and prognostic information disclosure, preferences for family roles in decision making, preferences for life-sustaining treatments, and preferences for place of death. Finally, the paper identifies limitations of existing studies and highlights issues for health professionals working with Chinese communities. We aim to draw out the implications for culturally competent practice in palliative care. From this we identify assumptions made by palliative care services that may be countercultural and have unintended consequences.

 {"title":"Dietary exposure to genistein increases vasopressin but does not alter beta-endorphin in the rat hypothalamus.","authors":["Scallet AC.","Wofford M.","Meredith JC.","Allaben WT.","Ferguson SA."],"abstract":"Genistein is a plant-derived estrogenic isoflavone commonly found in soy-based products such as soymilk and soy-based dietary supplements for treating menopausal symptoms, for example. Vasopressin is a neurosecretory nonapeptide synthesized primarily in neurons of the hypothalamus and secreted into the bloodstream from the posterior lobe of the pituitary. The endogenous opiate peptide beta-endorphin is synthesized both in neurons of the hypothalamus and in pituitary cells, primarily of the neurointermediate lobe. It has been reported that exposure to 17beta-estradiol or diethylstilbesterol increased the vasopressin content of the hypothalamus, and that estradiol valerate selectively damages hypothalamic beta-endorphin-containing neurons. Since little was known of the potential effects of estrogenic endocrine-disruptor compounds on hypothalamic neuropeptides, we fed Sprague-Dawley fetuses from day 7 in utero until sacrifice at postnatal day 77, with either a control diet (<1 ppm) or an experimental diet containing 25, 250, or 1250 ppm of genistein. We then conducted ELISA assays for hypothalamic content of both beta-endorphin and vasopressin immunoreactivity. Whereas there were no statistically reliable effects of dietary genistein on hypothalamic beta-endorphin content, vasopressin levels were significantly elevated in the 1250-ppm genistein group (p < 0.05). Elevated vasopressin levels may be associated with fluid balance, altered blood pressure, and cardiovascular effects. These data are consistent with the known actions of estradiol and may serve to explain our finding in a previous study that estrogenic endocrine-disruptors such as genistein increased sodium preference in rats exposed through their diet.","published_year":2003,"pages":"296-300","journal":"Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology"},

The major aim of this work was to determine the impact of severe congenital cardiopathology (SCC) on the central nervous system (CNS) through the study of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the assessment of neurodevelopment. Population and methods: Children under 3 years old, 41 of them presenting SCC and 15 healthy controls (C) were studied. Conventional EEG recording and assessment of neurodevelopment were performed. Results: In twenty children presenting SCC (48.8\\) the EEG was found abnormal (paroxysmal of spikes and sharp waves). Forty of them (97.6\\) presented neurodevelopmental alterations, including hypotonia and a delay in gross motor skills. When comparing EEG between SCC and C children, odds ratio was 13.33 (1.602-111) and comparing neurodevelopment delay, it was 35 (3.769-235). Both were statistically significant (p <= 0.00039 and p <= 0.00038, respectively). Conclusions: A high percentage of children suffering from SCC exhibited EEG patterns with abnormal epileptic-like activity although without clinical manifestation of seizures.

Public health nurses play an important role in promoting community health. Policymaking for community healthcare should reflect the relationship between health-promoting behavior and depression in community-dwelling seniors. Therefore, the encouragement of healthy aging requires strategic planning by those who provide health promotion services.\rOBJECTIVE: This study was designed to elicit the health-promoting behaviors of community seniors and investigate the relationship between geriatric depression and health-promoting behaviors among seniors who live in rural communities.\rMETHODS: We used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and collected data using a demographic information datasheet, the Health Promotion for Seniors and Geriatric Depression Scale short forms.\rRESULTS: The study included 427 participants.

This paper analyzes the case of TB in Phoenix, Arizona, USA during its period of early growth (1880-1946) to demonstrate how social constructions of disease intersected with political constructions of race and class to produce pathologized bodies and stigmatized places. Contradictions in Phoenix's pro-growth strategy are discussed in this paper, along with strategies employed by city leaders to 'solve' them. These strategies included an emergent discourse by those in power that served to construct race, class and place-based inequities. Further, ideological and spatial strategies were instantiated to ensure that other Phoenix residents did not 'see' the injustices being produced. The material results of these discursive strategies included dilapidated housing, a lack of urban infrastructure, and lack of health-care services for minorities and the poor in Phoenix. Those in power, in the name of private accumulation and urban growth, had constructed a context in which poor persons with TB were spatially isolated and socially stigmatized while wealthy whites with TB were socially, culturally and environmentally advantaged.","published_year":2006,"pages":"603-16","journal":"Health Place"},

 {"title":"Role of radiotherapy in melanoma management","authors":["Strojan, P."],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: In melanoma, radiotherapy has generally been considered as a palliative treatment option indicated only for advanced cases or disseminated disease. In the 70s of the previous century, the technological advances in radiotherapy, linked to rapid development of computer sciences, resulted in restored interest for radiotherapy in melanoma management. Although a fundamental lack of well designed prospective and/or randomized clinical trials critically influenced the integration of radiotherapy into treatment strategies in melanoma, radiotherapy was recently recognized as an indispensable part in the multidisciplinary management of patients with melanoma. Altogether, approximately 23% of melanoma patients should receive at least one course of radiotherapy during the course of the disease. In this review, radiobiological properties of melanoma that govern the decisions for the fractionation patterns used in the treatment of this disease are described. Moreover, the indications for irradiation and the results of pertinent clinical studies from the literature, creating a rationale for the use of radiotherapy in the management of this disease, are reviewed and a brief description of radiotherapy techniques is given. CONCLUSIONS: Basic treatment modality in melanoma is surgery. However, whenever surgery is not radical or there are adverse prognostic factors identified on histopathological examination of resected tissue specimen, it needs to be supplemented. Also, in patients with unresectable disease or in those not being suitable for major surgery or who refuse proposed surgical intervention, other effective mode(s) of therapy need to be implemented. From this perspective, supported by clinical experiences and literature results, radiotherapy is a valuable option: it is effective and safe, in curative and palliative setting.","published_year":2010,"pages":"1-12","journal":""},

Hemodynamic perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been used in clinics for a series of applications including tumor characterization (histological type diagnosis and grading), diagnosis and the follow up of stroke, and several other disorders. For this study a platform to investigate the theoretical basis of perfusion imaging was developed. Using dynamic measurements of contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and mean transit time (MTT) are calculated. These three parameters are quantized, and displayed as color images for diagnostic and follow up studies. The comparative studies in MR perfusion must address issues such as; image registration, region of interest (ROI) selection, threshold identification and quantization of rCBV, rCBF and rMTT. The evaluation process involved the comparison of the diagnostic capabilities of the three perfusion images (rCBV, rCBF, MTT). Digital Substraction angiography was used as the gold standard in these comparisons. The study group comprises 16 patients with the diagnosis of subarachnoid bleeding and intracranial aneurysms. The proposed cerebral MR perfusion analysis system has been accepted by the radiologists as a useful tool for their perfusion studies and clinical evaluation.","published_year":2005,"pages":"5794-7","journal":"Conference proceedings : ...

J.","Antoine, P."],"abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences and adjustment modes of couples during the period between the initial signs of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the years following diagnosis, particularly in the case of early-onset AD. DESIGN: A dyadic interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted with married couples in which one member of each couple received a diagnosis of probable early-onset AD (before 65 years of age). PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen young couples, followed by the National Reference Centre for Young Persons with AD, agreed to participate. For seven of the couples, the caregiver was a woman. The mean age was 57.4 (SD = 4.2) for the caregivers and 57.3 (SD = 4.1) for the persons with AD. METHODS: The semi-structured interviews were conducted in the couples' homes. Each interview was conducted with both spouses to capture their interactions in the context of individual and shared experiences. RESULTS: Two higher-order themes emerged from the analyses: the 'need to know' and, after the diagnosis, the 'need not to know more'. Indeed, the first signs mark the beginning of a period of doubt and a search for understanding. This pursuit of knowledge progresses to the recognition of more intense and severe signs that encourage couples to seek medical attention. Both reassuring and destabilising, the diagnosis is a breaking point that modifies how the changes and painful effects associated with disease are experienced. Couples employ strategies to minimise their suffering and consequently their knowledge about the disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the couples oscillate between the need to know and the fear of knowing. To protect themselves, they use strategies to reduce their suffering and to distance the disease. The use of these avoidance strategies indicates that certain times in the course of disease management are less appropriate for couples to accept the assistance offered by formal caregivers.","published_year":2015,"pages":"","journal":"Scand J Caring Sci"},

Because Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol inhibited prolactin (Prl) secretion following its intraventricular injection into male rats, we hypothesized that AEA would have a similar effect. Estrogen modifies many hormonal responses and is known to increase Prl secretion. Therefore, we hypothesized that responses to intraventricular AEA would change depending on the gonadal steroid environment. Consequently, we evaluated the effects of lateral cerebral ventricular microinjection of AEA (20 ng) into male, ovariectomized (OVX), and estrogen-primed (OVX-E) rats. AEA decreased plasma Prl in male rats, had little effect in OVX females, and increased Prl in OVX-E rats. The results were at least partially mediated by changes in dopaminergic turnover, altering the inhibitory dopaminergic control of Prl release by the anterior pituitary gland. Thus, dopamine turnover was increased in the male rats and decreased significantly in OVX and in OVX-E rats. The changes in Prl may be caused not only by altered dopamine input to the anterior pituitary gland but also by effects of AEA on other transmitters known to alter Prl release. Importantly, in OVX-E rats, the elevated Prl release and the response to AEA were blocked by the AEA antagonist, indicating that AEA is a synaptic transmitter released from neurons that decrease inhibitory control of Prl release.","published_year":2003,"pages":"2134-9","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"},

Many patients in the inpatient setting, receiving end of life care have been observed to have a sometimes desperate need for information about cancer and its treatment. Many have not had the luxury of a full, unhurried discussion with their treating Doctor or health care team about the various implications of their diagnosis. Anxiety and fear can be consuming.

We investigated the prognostic value of CTA and CTP for clinical outcome and determined whether they have additional prognostic value over patient characteristics and non-contrast CT (NCCT). Methods: We included 1,374 patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke in the prospective multicenter Dutch acute stroke study. Sixty percent of the cohort was used for deriving the predictors and the remaining 40% for validating them. We calculated the predictive values of CTA and CTP predictors for poor clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3-6). Associations between CTA and CTP predictors and poor clinical outcome were assessed with odds ratios (OR). Multivariable logistic regression models were developed based on patient characteristics and NCCT predictors, and subsequently CTA and CTP predictors were added. The increase in area under the curve (AUC) value was determined to assess the additional prognostic value of CTA and CTP. Model validation was performed by assessing discrimination and calibration. Results: Poor outcome occurred in 501 patients (36.5%). Each of the evaluated CTA measures strongly predicted outcome in univariable analyses: the positive predictive value (PPV) was 59% for Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) <7 on CTA source images (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.3-4.8), 63% for presence of a proximal intracranial occlusion (OR 5.1; 95% CI 3.7-7.1), 66% for poor leptomeningeal collaterals (OR 4.3; 95% CI 2.8-6.6), and 58% for a >70% carotid or vertebrobasilar stenosis/occlusion (OR 3.2; 95% CI 2.2-4.6). The same applied to the CTP measures, as the PPVs were 65% for ASPECTS <7 on cerebral blood volume maps (OR 5.1; 95% CI 3.7-7.2) and 53% for ASPECTS <7 on mean transit time maps (OR 3.9; 95% CI 2.9-5.3). The prognostic model based on patient characteristics and NCCT measures was highly predictive for poor clinical outcome (AUC 0.84; 95% CI 0.81-0.86). Adding CTA and CTP predictors to this model did not improve the predictive value (AUC 0.85; 95% CI 0.83-0.88). In the validation cohort, the AUC values were 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.82) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.83), respectively. Calibration of the models was satisfactory. Conclusions: In patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke, admission CTA and CTP parameters are strong predictors of poor outcome and can be used to predict long-term clinical outcome. In multivariable prediction models, however, their additional prognostic value over patient characteristics and NCCT is limited in an unselected stroke population.

H.","Espeland, M."],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine if basic differences exist between the patients and caregivers of a representative group of dementia-nonspecific medical versus social adult day care centers with specific programs for dementia patients., DESIGN: A telephone interview questionnaire survey., SETTING: North Central North Carolina., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 242 adult day care dementia patients and caregivers from three medical and three social nondementia-specific adult day care centers., MEASUREMENTS: Dementia patient variables: Day care subtype (medical or social); length of stay; number of days attended; age; sex; race; educational level; marital status; religious affiliation; income; living status; number of medical conditions; number of prescription medications; function; ADL status (walking, eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting); continence status; number and type of abnormal behaviors; formal help status (hospitalization during day care, part or full-time nursing home attendance, or home healthcare assistance); transportation; and financial assistance. Caregiver variables: day care subtype; age; sex; race; educational level; marital status; religious affiliation; income; number of medical conditions; number of prescription medications; informal help (family friends or other non-paid help); paid help (friend, other, home health, or nursing home); relationship to patient; employment status; and level of caregiver burden., MAIN RESULTS: There were 144 medical and 62 social adult day care dementia patients and caregivers who agreed to participate. The average age of the patient was 77.9 years (SD +/- 8.4), and that of the caregiver was 57.7 years (SD +/- 13.9); 68.4% of the patients and 75.4% of the caregivers were females. Dementia patients in the medical subtype day care had a shorter length of stay than social day care patients; this did not reach statistical significance. There were significantly more white patients and caregivers in the medical than in the social subtype day care, 83.1% versus 50% and 83.3% versus 50.8%, respectively. Dementia patients of the medical subtype also had significantly more education, income, less function, and more symptoms of depression than dementia patients in the social subtype. Dementia patients of the medical subtype also had more abnormal psychological behaviors than their social subtype counterparts, with borderline significance (P = .071). There were more married caregivers in the medical subtype than in the social subtype day care. Caregivers of dementia patients in the medical subtype had significantly more paid help and caregiver burden than did caregivers of dementia patients in the social subtype., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there appear to be key differences between the dementia patients and caregivers of medical versus social adult day care centers as to demographic and health-related variables. The differences in demographic variables appear to be associated with socioeconomic factors, whereas the decreased function and greater number of depressive symptoms of the medical dementia patients may reflect poorer health as reflected by the greater amount of paid help and increased caregiver burden experienced by the caregivers of medical dementia patients. These findings should be verified in prospective studies.","published_year":1996,"pages":"654-9","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society"},

It is unknown whether Doppler-based diastolic dysfunction (DDF) retains its prognostic value in ICM patients, in the context of current imaging, medical, and device therapies. METHODS: Diastolic function was evaluated in ICM patients (LVEF </= 40% and >/= 70% stenosis in >/= 1 coronary artery) who underwent transthoracic echocardiogram and delayed hyperenhancement CMR studies within 7 days. The association of DDF with the combined end point was assessed after risk-adjustment using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: A total of 360 patients with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF = 24 +/- 9%) and extensive MSB (31 +/- 17%) were evaluated; DDF was present in all patients (stage 1%-44%, stage 2%-25%, stage 3%-31%). There were 130 events (124 deaths and 6 heart transplants) over a median follow-up of 5.8 years (IQR, 3.7-7.4 years). On multivariable analysis, DDF > stage 1 (HR, 1.37; P = .007) was associated with the combined end-point, independent of clinical risk score (HR, 2.40; P < .0001), implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation (HR, 0.60; P = .009), incomplete revascularization (HR, 1.32; P = .003), mitral regurgitation (HR, 3.37; P = .01), peri-infarct zone area (HR, 1.04; P = 0.02), and MSB (HR, 1.02; P = .01). DDF had incremental prognostic value for the combined end-point (model chi(2) increased from 89 to 95, P = .02).

 {"title":"Rough Edges in the Alignment of Legal Systems in the Proceedings at the ICTY","authors":["Robinson, Patrick L."],"abstract":"The paper focuses on various areas in which there is tension between the adversarial and the inquisitorial systems in the application of the Statute and Rules governing International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia proceedings: (i) the admissibility of evidence in written form with regard to crimes committed not by the accused but by his subordinates (Rule 92bis (A)), or of a transcript of evidence given by a witness in other proceedings before the Tribunal (Rule 92bis (D)); (ii) the possibility of a judgment of acquittal at the end of the prosecution case (Rule 98bis); (iii) the Trial Chamber's power to summon witnesses on a defence submission of ‘no case to answer’; (iv) the possibility for a party calling a witness to cross-examine him if he proves to be hostile; and (v) the right of a party to request an interview with a witness of the opposing party in preparation for trial. The author contends that in these areas, the most recent developments in the case law offer clear illustrations of the potential for a collision between the common-law and civil-law systems. He concludes that, if not properly resolved, tension between the two systems may lead to unfairness.

 {"title":"College administrators' perceptions of the value of leadership/administrative training programs for aspiring administrators","authors":["Horner, Linda Traywick"],"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate how participation in leadership/administrative training programs is perceived by selected administrators who recommend candidates for appointment to academic administrative positions in two-year colleges. The subjects in this research included 192 chief academic officers of two-year colleges listed in Who's Who in Community Colleges. A stratified sample was selected to assure (a) equal representation from the six regions served by regional accrediting associations and (b) proportional representation of male and female chief academic officers within each region. A survey instrument titled The Employment Criteria Survey was developed by the researcher. The first part of the survey requests information concerning the respondent's age, gender, and past participation in leadership/ administrative training programs. In the second part of the survey, respondents were asked to assign values to selected qualifications and characteristics of a hypothetical candidate who is being considered for appointment to an academic administrative position. Eight questions were investigated by the researcher to examine the value that administrators would assign to specific qualifications or characteristics of candidates. The frequency and percentage of each rating value were recorded for each item. The mean and standard deviation for the rating values were determined for each item. The results of these descriptive statistics were interpreted for answers to the research questions. Sixteen hypotheses were tested. The statistical procedure used was analysis of variance and the significance level was 5%. The findings included: (1) Candidates' experience of more than five years as a department chair, college level administrator, or faculty member is perceived as more valuable than participation in training programs. (2) Candidates' education of an earned doctorate in administration of higher education or a field other than education is perceived (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","published_year":1996,"pages":"0530","journal":"Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences"},

To achieve the best possible treatment a continual analysis of results is necessary. The present study analyzes 1225 consecutive patients undergoing isolated aortocoronary bypass surgery for the four-year period ending September 1993. Average age was 63 years (range 32-86 years), 927 (75.7%) patients were male and 298 (24.3%) were female. Hospital mortality was 2.2% (17/787) for elective surgery, 6.3% (21/336) for urgent surgery, and 9.8% (8/82) for emergency surgery. Intraoperative variables increasing independently operative mortality as evidenced by multivariate analysis were the following: prolonged aortic cross-clamping time (p < 0.0001), absence of cold-blood cardioplegia (p = 0.0012), absence of bilateral use of internal mammary artery (p = 0.0035). Likewise, intraoperative variables influencing major adverse outcome (operative mortality and/or need for intra-aortic balloon pulsation) were the following: prolonged aortic cross-clamping time (p < 0.0001), absence of cold-blood cardioplegia (p = 0.0360). In conclusion, global ischemic time was the dominant variable in predicting operative outcome. Furthermore, a protective effect of cold blood cardioplegia and bilateral internal mammary artery grafting was evidenced.","published_year":1995,"pages":"134-41","journal":"The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon"},

Medicare ACOs are responsible for 8 measures of preventive care quality.\rOBJECTIVES: To create composite measures of preventive care quality and examine associations of ACO characteristics with performance.\rDESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study of Medicare Shared Savings Program and Pioneer participants. We linked quality performance to descriptive data from the National Survey of ACOs. We created composite measures using exploratory factor analysis, and used regression to assess associations with organizational characteristics.\rRESULTS: Of 252 eligible ACOs, 246 reported on preventive care quality, 177 of which completed the survey (response rate=72%). In their first year, ACOs lagged behind PPO performance on the majority of comparable measures. We identified 2 underlying factors among 8 measures and created composites for each: disease prevention, driven by vaccines and cancer screenings, and wellness screening, driven by annual health screenings. Participation in the Advanced Payment Model, having fewer specialists, and having more Medicare ACO beneficiaries per primary care provider were associated with significantly better performance on both composites. Better performance on disease prevention was also associated with inclusion of a hospital, greater electronic health record capabilities, a larger primary care workforce, and fewer minority beneficiaries.\rCONCLUSIONS: ACO preventive care quality performance is related to provider composition and benefitted by upfront investment. Vaccine and cancer screening quality performance is more dependent on organizational structure and characteristics than performance on annual wellness screenings, likely due to greater complexity in eligibility determination and service administration.","published_year":2016,"pages":"326-35","journal":"Medical Care"},

P.","Patil, M."],"abstract":"Aim and Objectives: The aim of this study was to see if the fertility outcome improved when IVF/ICSI was done after administration of GnRH analogs and cyst aspiration in comparison with patients in whom either only cyst aspiration or only GnRh analogs were administered. Materials and methods: This was a prospective study done in a tertiary level ART center which included 30 patients over a span of 5 years from 2004 to 2009. All of them had endometriomas and underwent assisted reproductive techniques (ART) either after cyst aspiration with or without GnRH analog pretreatment or only GnRH analog pretreatment. Depending on the pretreatment received, they were classified into three groups: * Group B: Both GnRH analog and cyst aspiration * Group C: Only cyst aspiration * Group G: Only GnRH analog. The patients were not randomized. The number of days required for stimulation, total dose of stimulation required, number of oocytes obtained, quality of embryos, and the pregnancy rates for each group were tabulated for comparison. Statistical analysis: The significance of the difference in ART outcome after the different modalities of pretreatment, which was estimated in terms of pregnancy rates was evaluated by calculating the p-value. Observations and results: Significant difference was observed between the pregnancy rates in the three groups, with the maximum pregnancy rate in group B, followed by the group G and then the group C. The p-value showed a trend, though not statistically significant, indicating the need for larger prospective studies with greater number of subjects. Conclusion: Pretreating endometriomas by aspirating the cysts and administering three doses of GnRH analog depot preparation prior to IVF/ICSI seems to be better than administering GnRH analog depot preparation alone or aspirating the cysts alone in terms of the number of days required for stimulation, the number of oocytes obtained, and the clinical pregnancy rates.","published_year":2011,"pages":"23-31","journal":"International Journal of Infertility and Fetal Medicine"},

However, despite the importance of pollen evolution in the genus comprehensive studies with electron microscopy and evaluation of pollen evolution are lacking. Therefore, we studied pollen morphology in a sample of 65 individuals from 37 taxa covering all the sections distributed in the world, using scanning electron microscopy. Our collection of 49 individuals from 21 taxa covering all five sections in China was also included in the database. We found pollen tetrads in L. bakerianum. Based on present and previous studies, our results suggest that pollen from L. formosanum should be classified as a new type, Formosanum. Combined with morphological and molecular evidence, pollen sculpture patterns appear to reflect phylogenetic relationships and are useful for species or subsection delimitation. Based on a comprehensive survey and correlation with potential functional implications, we propose the following hypothesis: evolution of an exine sculpture shows pollen type trends from Martagon → Callose → Concolor → Formosanum. The evolutionary trend regarding pollen sculpture and size could be related to selective pressure to adapt to environmental conditions. Pollen size and shape showed a significantly positive correlation with annual precipitation, and smaller pollen grains appear to adapt better in habitats with extreme conditions. Evolution trends in exine sculpture do not appear to be definitively correlated with pollen size and shape.","published_year":2014,"pages":"e87841","journal":"PloS one"},

The study was a 6-week randomized controlled trial that included 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. After 10 days of baseline activity, patients were randomized into 2 groups: control and active. The control group (n = 15) was instructed to continue with their baseline activity for 6 weeks. The active group (n = 15) was instructed to walk at least 10000 steps per day 5 or more days per week, for 6 weeks. Data relevant to glycemic control and other parameters of health were collected at study weeks 0 and 6. There were no differences in the baseline activity between groups (P = .36). Subjects in the active group significantly increased physical activity by 69% during the intervention phase of the study (P = .002), whereas there was no change in the physical activity of the control group (P > .05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and resting energy expenditure significantly increased in the active group (P < .05). Finally, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) activity was reduced by exercise relative to the control group (P = .03). There were no differences in any other study parameters during the 6-week study. In conclusion, short-term intervention with a pedometer increased physical activity and positively affected plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity in previously inactive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The use of a pedometer may prove to be an effective tool for promoting healthy lifestyle changes that include daily physical activity and self-monitoring of therapeutic goals.","published_year":2006,"pages":"1382-1387","journal":"Metabolism: clinical and experimental"},
 {"title":"Origin of synchronized oscillations induced by neocortical disinhibition in vivo.","authors":["Castro-Alamancos MA."],"abstract":"During disinhibition, the neocortex generates synchronous activities. Block of GABA(A) receptors in neocortex transforms cortical slow-wave oscillations into large-amplitude approximately 1 Hz discharges consisting of a negative spike or multiple negative spikes riding on a positive wave. Further block of GABA(B) receptors in neocortex slows the discharges to approximately 0.5 Hz and increments the number of negative spikes forming rhythmic approximately 10 Hz neocortical oscillations. Although the thalamus responds robustly to these neocortical discharges, these are unaffected by thalamic inactivation using tetrodotoxin. Thus, an important problem relates to the origin of these activities within the neocortex. Current source density analysis and intracellular recordings revealed that the first negative spike in a discharge corresponded to a current sink that reflected a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS) and could originate in the lower layers or in the upper layers. Regardless of the origin (upper or lower layer), the initial current sink always spreads to the same site in upper layer V-IV. In contrast, the approximately 10 Hz oscillation that follows the initial negative spike corresponds to current sinks that always originate in the lower layers but do not spread to upper layer V-IV, jumping directly to the upper layers. Each current sink in the approximately 10 Hz oscillation reflects a small PDS and is followed by a current source that reflects the repolarization after each PDS.","published_year":2000,"pages":"9195-206","journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience"},

This model can be used to implement mechanisms that enable application execution progress even in the presence of failures, such as those presented by the MAG middleware (Mobile Agents for Grids). MAG includes retrying, replication, and checkpointing as fault-tolerance techniques; they operate independently from each other and are not capable of detecting changes on resource availability. In this paper, we describe a MAG extension that is capable of migrating agents when nodes fail, that optimizes application progress by keeping only the most advanced checkpoint, and that migrates slow replicas.","published_year":2009,"pages":"Professional; IFIP; USENIX","journal":""},

The analysis was based on pooled data from two Phase IIIstudies of adalimumab in active AS. Patients with an inadequate response to ≥1 NSAID received adalimumab 40 mg every other week (n = 246) or placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks. A microsimulation model was developed with patients being treated with adalimumab according to the International ASAS Consensus Statement and BSR guidelines. The pooled adalimumab data, as well as data from the Outcome Assessment in AS International Study (OASIS) database and the literature, were used to model patients' BASDAI and BASFI scores and costs and health-related quality of life associated with various degrees of disease activity. Costs (in 2004 British £) of AS, drug, administration, monitoring, hospitalization and AEs were calculated from the perspective of the UK NHS. Discounting was applied at 3.5% per year for costs and benefits as per the NICE reference case for economic evaluations. Uncertainty was addressed via sensitivity analyses. Results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adalimumab vs conventional therapy was estimated to improve with longer time horizons (48 weeks to 5 and 30 yrs). The central estimate was that, over 30 yrs, adalimumab therapy yielded 1.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient initiating therapy. Some AS treatment-related costs were estimated to be offset by adalimumab (at £ 10750/patient), leaving a total incremental cost (adalimumab vs conventional therapy) at £23 857 per patient. The 30-yr ICER of adalimumab vs conventional therapy was estimated at £23 097/QALY. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of results. When indirect costs were also included (analysis from societal perspective), ICER improved to £5093/QALY. Conclusions. This analysis indicates that adalimumab, when used according to UK treatment guidelines, is cost-effective vs conventional therapy for treating AS patients. © The Author 2007.","published_year":2007,"pages":"1320-1328","journal":"Rheumatology"},

Sleep problems in children with ADHD can result in poorer child functioning, impacting on school attendance, daily functioning and behaviour, as well as parental mental health and work attendance. The Sleeping Sound with ADHD trial aims to investigate the efficacy of a behavioural sleep program in treating sleep problems experienced by children with ADHD. We have demonstrated the feasibility and the acceptability of this treatment program in a pilot study. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomised controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted with 198 children (aged between 5 to 12 years) with ADHD and moderate to severe sleep problems. Children are recruited from public and private paediatric practices across the state of Victoria, Australia. Upon receiving informed written consent, families are randomised to receive either the behavioural sleep intervention or usual care. The intervention consists of two individual, face-to-face consultations and a follow-up phone call with a trained clinician (trainee consultant paediatrician or psychologist), focusing on the assessment and management of child sleep problems. The primary outcome is parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptoms (ADHD Rating Scale IV). Secondary outcomes are child sleep (actigraphy and parent report), behaviour, daily functioning, school attendance and working memory, as well as parent mental health and work attendance. We are also assessing the impact of children's psychiatric comorbidity (measured using a structured diagnostic interview) on treatment outcome. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT of a behavioural intervention aiming to treat sleep problems in children with ADHD. If effective, this program will provide a feasible non-pharmacological and acceptable intervention improving child sleep and ADHD symptoms in this patient group.

We evaluated the effectiveness of the CBCHS campaign program in sensitizing parents/guardians to encourage HPV vaccine uptake, identified factors that influence parents' decisions to vaccinate girls, and examined the uptake of cervical cancer screening among mothers. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in four healthcare facilities run by CBCHS, churches and other social settings. A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed and 317 were used for the analysis. There were high levels of awareness about cervical cancer, HPV and HPV vaccine. 75.5% understood HPV is sexually transmitted and 90.3% were aware of the use of vaccine as a preventive measure. Effectiveness of the vaccine (31.8%) and side effects/safety (18.4%) were the major barriers for parents to vaccinate their daughters. Bivariate analysis further revealed that the level of education (p - 0.0006), income level (p - 0.0044) and perceived risks (p - 0.0044) are additional factors influencing parents' decisions to vaccinate girls. 35.3% of women had sought a cervical cancer screening, significantly higher than the general estimated rate of screening (<10%) in other parts of Cameroon and sub-Saharan Africa. These results support the viability of a community-tailored sensitization strategy to increase awareness among the targeted audience of parents/guardians, who are critical decision-makers for vaccine delivery to children. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","published_year":2012,"pages":"917-926","journal":"Journal of Community Health"},

R."],"abstract":"AIMS: The abdominal hypopressive technique (AHT) is performed mainly via transversus abdominis (TrA) activation and has been indicated for pelvic floor muscle (PFM) disorders. In some European countries, this technique has become widely used. This study aimed to investigate PFM and TrA activation during the AHT through surface electromyography. METHODS: Thirty-four nulliparous physical therapists in good general health were asked to participate in the trial. To ascertain a correct PFM contraction, each of the participants was assessed by inspection and digital palpation. Ability to contract the TrA was assessed by surface electromyography and AHT training was given before analysis. TrA and PFM activity was recorded using surface electromyography. RESULTS: The mean age of the volunteers was 28.1 (+/-6.0) [THIN SPACE]years and the mean body mass index was 23.7 (+/-3.3) [THIN SPACE]kg/m(2) . More than half of the volunteers were physically active (61.3%) and regularly performed PFM training (52.9%) but not TrA exercises (58.8%). Although the AHT activates the PFM when compared to resting tone (P[THIN SPACE]<[THIN SPACE]0.001), this method is significantly less effective than PFM alone (P[THIN SPACE]<[THIN SPACE]0.001). Additionally, the combination of the two techniques (AHT[THIN SPACE]+[THIN SPACE]PFM) was similarly effective as isolated PFM contraction (P[THIN SPACE]=[THIN SPACE]0.586). Although the AHT activated the TrA significantly more than did PFM alone (P[THIN SPACE]=[THIN SPACE]0.002), the addition of PFM contraction to the AHT significantly increased the amount of TrA activation (P[THIN SPACE]<[THIN SPACE]0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, the AHT is less effective than PFM contraction alone, and adding PFM contraction to AHT also improves the TrA contraction.

 {"title":"Regional overview of maternal and child malnutrition: trends, interventions and outcomes","authors":["Djazayery, A."],"abstract":"The proportions of underweight, wasted, and stunted children, as well as the infant and under-5 mortality rates, have all exhibited downward trends in the Region over the past 2 decades. This is in part attributable to maternal and child nutrition intervention programmes, especially those in which women were actively involved. Programmes which support and promote breastfeeding, such as the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, have also contributed to this trend, although the number of baby friendly hospitals varies considerably between countries. Available information also shows that anemia is quite common among women, many of whom also have a low weight and stature and seem to suffer from osteoporosis. In several countries of the Region a number of micronutrient deficiency control programmes are in progress, such as iron supplementation for pregnant women, fortification of flour and iodization of salt. Iodine deficiency disorders are under control in 2 countries of the Region and legislation for salt iodization is in place in 17 countries. Prevalence of severe malnutrition in children is much lower than that of milder levels, thus, promotion of the nutrition status of mildly to moderately malnourished children could lead to a sizeable reduction in child mortality.","published_year":2004,"pages":"731-736 6p","journal":"Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal"},

Ideal KM combines different sources of knowledge to support innovation and improve performance. Purposes: Despite the importance of KM in health care organizations (HCOs), there has been very little empirical research to describe KM in this context. This study explores KM in HCOs, focusing on the status of current intraorganizational KM. The intention is to provide insight for future studies and model development for effective KM implementation in HCOs. Methodology/Approach: A qualitative methods approach was used to create an empirically based model of KM in HCOs. Methods included (a) qualitative interviews (n = 24) with senior leadership to identify types of knowledge important in these roles plus current information-seeking behaviors/needs and (b) in-depth case study with leaders in new executive positions (n = 2). The data were collected from 10 HCOs. Our empirically based model for KM was assessed for face and content validity. Findings: The findings highlight the paucity of formal KM in our sample HCOs. Organizational culture, leadership, and resources are instrumental in supporting KM processes. An executive's knowledge needs are extensive, but knowledge assets are often limited or difficult to acquire as much of the available information is not in a usable format. We propose an empirically based model for KM to highlight the importance of context (internal and external), and knowledge seeking, synthesis, sharing, and organization. Participants who reviewed the model supported its basic components and processes, and potential for incorporating KM into organizational processes. Discussion: Our results articulate ways to improve KM, increase organizational learning, and support evidence-informed decision-making. Practice implications: This research has implications for how to better integrate evidence and knowledge into organizations while considering context and the role of organizational processes.","published_year":2016,"pages":"64-74","journal":"Health Care Management Review"},

Dysphagia is a common complication of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy in tongue cancer patients. Previous studies have attempted to identify risk factors for dysphagia in patients with head and neck cancer, but no studies have focused specifically on tongue cancer patients. This study was conducted on 133 patients who were diagnosed with tongue cancer and who underwent a videofluoroscopy swallowing study (VFSS) between January 2007 and June 2012 at the Asan Medical Center. Data collected from the VFSS were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with aspiration were identified. Patients showed a higher incidence of inadequate tongue control, inadequate chewing, delayed oral transit time, aspiration or penetration, vallecular pouch and pyriform residue, and inadequate laryngeal elevation after surgery. Moreover, male gender, extensive tumor resection, a higher node stage, and more extensive lymph node dissection were major risk factors for aspiration in tongue cancer patients. Tongue cancer patients have difficulties in the pharyngeal phase as well as the oral phase of swallowing. These difficulties can worsen after tongue cancer surgery. Gender, the extent of tumor resection, and lymph node metastasis affect swallowing in tongue cancer patients. Physicians should take these risk factors into account when administering swallowing therapy to tongue cancer patients.","published_year":2015,"pages":"210-7","journal":"Annals of rehabilitation medicine"},

Among all the potential comorbidities, co-occurring anxiety disorders stand out due to their very high prevalence. Outcome in bipolar illness is worse in the presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder. The coexistence of an anxiety disorder presents a particularly difficult challenge in the treatment of bipolar illness since antidepressants, the mainstay of pharmacologic treatments for anxiety, may adversely alter the course of manic-depression. Identification of anxiety disorders in bipolar patients is important.

Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of registered nurses working in 4 ICUs (surgical, medical, burns and neurology) of a large teaching hospital in Singapore. The questionnaire consisted of 3 sections. The first section gathered details about the respondent's demographics; the second section required respondents to rate (Likert scale 1 not important-4 very important) the importance of 18 different factors influencing decision to limit life support while the third section elicited responses about management strategy to 2 clinical scenarios from a possible pool of 6 different scenarios. Results: Eighty three nurses responded (response rate: 70%). Patient advance directives (mu = 3.63), likelihood of surviving current episode (mu = 3.52) and premorbid cognitive function (mu = 3.49) were the most important consideration factors for withdrawal of life support. Across various clinical scenarios, majority (82.6%) reported that continue with current management is most likely to be in the patients' best interests. Level of agreement between what the respondents believed to be in the patient's best interest and their responses on what they would do if they encountered a similar case was good (Kappa = 0.78). For scenarios 1-4, respondents were significantly more likely (p < 0.05) to report that full aggressive/current treatment is in the patients' best interests in the scenario whereby the patient is younger. Conclusion: Respondents regarded patient advanced directives to be the most important determinants influencing decisions to withdraw life support. In general, nurses were uncomfortable with complete withdrawal of life support.

VCU School of Pharmacy pharmacist preceptors, students, and faculty members were eligible. The questionnaire contained items that assessed perceptions of chronic and acute care pharmacy practice and confidence in patient care and MTM activities. Demographic and practice site characteristics were also collected.\rRESULTS: A total of 974 preceptors, 515 students, and 78 faculty members were invited to participate, and 335 preceptors, 155 students, and 41 faculty members had usable responses, yielding response rates of 34%, 30%, and 53%, respectively. Preceptors, students, and faculty members favorably viewed direct patient care roles in the chronic and acute care settings. Pharmacists were very confident or confident in performing many patient care and MTM activities. They were least confident in considering genetic characteristics when adjusting medications and creating business plans for new services. Many pharmacists in chronic and acute care settings provided some type of patient care service, but few were regularly providing services. Inadequate time, staffing, and reimbursement, and lack of perceived value from patients and providers were most frequently cited as barriers to service provision.\rCONCLUSIONS: VCU preceptors, students, and faculty members overwhelmingly believe that pharmacists should provide direct patient care and MTM activities.

Objective: To study the impact of ACoRN on knowledge and selfconfidence with respect to neonatal stabilization in Chinese health professionals. Design/Methods: Following an initial instructor course, a team of Chinese ACoRN instructors provided instruction to professionals from several county hospitals. ACoRN materials were translated into Chinese.

This review examines gender differences in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of methadone, a long-acting opioid agonist that is prescribed as a treatment for opioid dependence and the management of chronic pain. METHOD: We performed a search in the Medline database from 1990 to 2014 in order to find published literature related to gender differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of methadone. RESULTS: None of the studies were carried out with the primary or secondary aim to identify any gender differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of methadone. Importantly; high inter-subjects variability in PK parameters was found also intra female population. The reported differences in volume of distribution could be ascribed to the physiological differences between men and women in body weight and composition, taking into account that the dose of methadone was established irrespective of body weight of patients (Peles and Adelson, 2006). On the other hand, the few studies present in literature found no gender difference in some direct pharmacodynamic parameters. Some reports have suggested that female gender is associated with an increased risk for long-QT-related cardiac arrhythmias in methadone maintenance subjects. CONCLUSION: Even though it may be too simplistic to expect variability only in one parameter to explain inter-individual variation in methadone response, we believe that a better knowledge of gender-related differences might have significant implications for better outcomes in opioid dependence substitution therapy in women.","published_year":2015,"pages":"122","journal":"Frontiers in pharmacology"},

We then evaluated the tissue concentrations of estrogens in ILC and IDC and subsequently estrogen-responsive gene profiles in these tumors in order to explore the possible differences and/or similarity of intratumoral estrogen environment of these two breast cancer subtypes. The status of STS and 17betaHSD1 was significantly lower in ILCs than IDCs (p = 0.022 and p < 0.0001), but that of EST and 17betaHSD2 vice versa (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0106).

Assessing smoke constituent exposure and any resulting harm reduction from a potential reduced-exposure product (PREP) will involve preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological research. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a clinical laboratory model for assessing the acute effects of PREPs for smokers. Philip Morris' Accord and R.J. Reynolds' Eclipse were used as examples. Twenty overnight-abstinent smokers (> 15 'light' or 'ultra-light' cigarettes/day) participated in 4 Latin-square ordered, 2.5-hr sessions in which they completed an 8-puff smoking bout every 30 minutes. Sessions were separated by at least 24 hours and differed by product used: own brand, denicotinized tobacco cigarettes, Accord, or Eclipse. Tobacco withdrawal and carbon monoxide (CO) were assessed before and after smoking, heart rate was assessed before and during smoking, and puff volume, duration, and interpuff interval were assessed while subjects smoked. Blood was sampled at the beginning and end of each session. Relative to normal cigarettes, Accord was less effective at suppressing withdrawal and produced minimal CO boost despite the fact that, when using Accord, subjects took bigger and longer puffs. Eclipse suppressed withdrawal fully and increased CO boost by approximately 30%. Own brand, Accord, and Eclipse, but not denicotinized cigarettes, increased plasma nicotine concentration. Taken together, these results suggest that neither Accord nor Eclipse is likely to be an effective reduced-exposure product for smokers and that this clinical laboratory model is valuable.

The authors have quantified the incidence of WE in patients undergoing craniotomy with motor mapping and have shown that there is no increased risk of developing a WE in the contralateral lower extremity when compression devices are not used. Methods. One hundred eighty consecutive cases (1997-2000) of craniotomy with motor mapping for glioma were retrospectively reviewed to determine the incidence and location of VTEs during the early postoperative course. Intraoperative WE prophylaxis in all patients consisted of ipsilateral (that is, ipsilateral to the hemisphere being mapped) lower-extremity mechanical prophylaxis (antiembolism stocking plus compression device). Postoperatively, all patients received bilateral mechanical prophylaxis. Patients were observed until discharge and received clinical follow up. Venous thromboembolism, classified as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) occurring within 6 weeks postoperatively, was confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography, spiral computerized tomography scanning, or both. The average duration of postoperative hospitalization was 5 days (range 2-59 days). Six patients (3.3%) experienced VTE. Of those, in four (2.2%) the DVT was localized to the contralateral (three patients) or ipsilateral (one patient) lower extremity. Two other patients (1.1%) only had PE. There were no deaths from thromboembolic complications and no statistically significant predisposition to WE in the contralateral lower extremity among patients not receiving intraoperative prophylaxis. Conclusions. The incidence of WE in patients undergoing craniotomy with motor mapping is comparable to that in patients receiving bilateral lower-extremity mechanical WE prophylaxis. The practice of leaving the contralateral lower extremity free from intraoperative prophylaxis does not appear to place patients at a higher risk for developing VTE. There appears to be no preferential distribution of WE in contralateral lower extremities that do not receive immediate preoperative and intraoperative mechanical prophylaxis.","published_year":2003,"pages":"680-684","journal":"J Neurosurg"},

However, information is lacking on the time-course relation of adiposity and fasting insulin from childhood to young adulthood in offspring of parents with CAD, a surrogate measure of future risk. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis was performed on data collected from the Bogalusa Heart Study cohort with (n = 271) and without (n = 805) a parental history of CAD followed since childhood by repeated surveys from 1973 to 1991. RESULTS: Lowess smoothing and multivariate analyses using Generalized Estimating Equations revealed that body mass index, triceps, and subscapular skinfolds were consistently higher from childhood to adulthood in offspring of parents with CAD history. Insulin levels during childhood and adolescence were lower in the offspring with affected parents. On the other hand, higher levels of fasting insulin from offspring were associated with positive parental history of CAD after age 20 and this association remained significant even after adjusting for body mass index. There was no significant interaction with race or sex in these relationships. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the offspring at high risk for CAD develop excess body fatness beginning in childhood and then later manifest hyperinsulinemia in young adulthood. These observations have important implications for prevention.","published_year":2002,"pages":"553-559 7p","journal":"Annals of Epidemiology"},

Literature was identified in Global Health, Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Popline, as well as peer reviewed journals. Articles were included if they were written in English, had an outcome evaluation of contraceptive use, modern contraceptive use, contraceptive initiation/uptake, contraceptive adherence or continuation of contraception, were a systematic review or randomised controlled trial, and were conducted in a low or middle income country. We assessed the behaviour change techniques used in each intervention and included a new category of male partner involvement. We identified six studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The most effective interventions were those that involve male partner involvement in the decision to initiate contraceptive use. The findings also suggest that providing access to contraceptives in the community promotes their use. The interventions that had positive effects on contraceptive use used a combination of behaviour change techniques. Performance techniques were not used in any of the interventions. The use of social support techniques, which are meant to improve wider social acceptability, did not appear except in two of the interventions. Our findings suggest that when information and contraceptives are provided, contraceptive use improves. Recommendations include reporting of behaviour change studies to include more details of the intervention and techniques employed. There is also a need for further research to understand which techniques are especially effective.","published_year":2015,"pages":"100","journal":"Reproductive health"},

Father’s participation in childcare and housework is one factor thought to minimize the stress and workload of wage-earning motherhood. Using an internet survey of Japanese women designed by the Japanese Institute for Labor Policy and Training (N = 495), this study explores the associations between labor force participation, unmet need for spousal support, and self-reported mental health of Japanese women with preschool-aged children. We find a positive relationship between mothers’ reports of unmet spousal need and perceived challenges to mental well-being. Results suggest that attention to maternal mental health and unmet spousal support need is needed not only for mothers who participate in the labor force but perhaps especially for stay-at-home mothers.

The results of the management of six pregnant burns patients, admitted during an 18-month period, were analysed. Successful management of burn injuries ranging from 25 to 65 per cent TBSA occurred in patients during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, using early burn wound excision and skin grafting in four patients and by late skin grafting of a granulating wound in one patient. All five patients delivered live babies with no congenital anomalies. One patient with 60 per cent TBSA burns who was unsuitable for early excision, died of septicaemia. This report suggests the need for early burn wound excision and skin grafting in burns patients with pregnancy, in order to improve maternal and fetal survival. However, in developing countries early surgery is not advisable in patients with extensive burns because of the non-availability of biological skin substitutes.","published_year":1996,"pages":"234-7","journal":"Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries"},

The soils were treated with sewage sludge at a rate of 0 and 30 Mg ha(-1). The greenhouse experiment was carried out through a completely randomized block design in a 2 x 4 (biosolid ratexsoil) arrangement, considering three repetitions per treatment. The soils used in the greenhouse experiment before and after cultivation, were sequentially extracted with specific reagents and conditions in order to obtain the following fractions: exchangeable, sodium acetate-soluble, soluble in moderately reducing condition, K(4)P(2)O(7)-soluble, soluble in reducing condition, and soluble in strongly acid and oxidizing condition. It was established that Cu and Zn were predominantly found in soils in less available forms, associated to organic matter, oxides and clay minerals. Zinc concentration in ryegrass plants was higher than that found in subterranean clover plants in biosolid-amended soils. Zinc contents in ryegrass shoot and root correlated with the exchangeable, bound-to-carbonate, and bound-to-FeOx metal forms in control soil. Copper and Zn bioavailabilities were estimated through satisfactorily fitted multiple linear regression models, with determination coefficients from 0.77 to 0.99, which showed a positive contribution of the labile metal forms in soils, especially in relation to Zn in both plant species.","published_year":2009,"pages":"2665-2671","journal":"Journal of environmental management"},

The effects of OSM stimulation on barrier function of normal human bronchial epithelial cells and nasal epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface were assessed by using transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran flux. Dual-color immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the integrity of tight junction structures in cultured epithelial cells.\rRESULTS: Analysis of samples from patients with CRS showed that OSM mRNA and protein levels were highly increased in nasal polyps compared with those seen in control uncinate tissue (P < .05). OSM levels were also increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of allergic asthmatic patients after segmental allergen challenge and in esophageal biopsy specimens from patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. OSM stimulation of air-liquid interface cultures resulted in reduced barrier function, as measured by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran flux (P < .05). Alterations in barrier function by OSM were reversible, and the viability of epithelial cells was unaffected. OSM levels in lysates of nasal polyps and uncinate tissue positively correlated with levels of alpha2-macroglobulin, a marker of epithelial leak, in localized nasal secretions (r = 0.4855, P < .05).\rCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that OSM might play a role in epithelial barrier dysfunction in patients with CRS and other mucosal diseases.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

D."],"abstract":"Purpose: To examine outcomes and complications of the porous polyurethaneurea (Artelon; Small Bone Innovations, Morrisville, PA) spacer compared to traditional surgical treatment of trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI). Methods: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of patients with carpometacarpal (CMC) arthritis who had either placement of an Artelon spacer or LRTI. Patients were brought back to clinic for interview and functional testing. Pain was graded using a visual analog scale. Grip and pinch strength, as well as range of motion at the first CMC joint, were measured. Nine-hole peg, Moberg pickup, and Jebson-Taylor tests were performed. Research and Development 36, Michigan Hand Outcomes, and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaires were administered. Results: Thirty-eight patients received Artelon implants into the CMC joint, and 6 were lost to follow-up. Twelve of 32 patients (37%) required revision surgery with removal of implant and salvage arthroplasty. Twenty patients with nonrevised Artelon implants were compared with 10 patients who received 13 LRTI procedures. Patients with Artelon had significantly less pain improvement compared to those receiving the LRTI procedure. In addition, satisfaction was significantly decreased. There was no significant difference in any other functional or quality of life measures. Conclusions: In our practice, use of the Artelon joint spacer resulted in an explantation rate of 37%. Due to these findings, we have abandoned its use for treatment of basilar thumb osteoarthritis. In contrast to previous studies, pain and satisfaction are worse in patients with intact Artelon spacers than those who had received LRTI.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of strength training (ST) versus power training (PT) on functional performance in prefrail older adults. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00783159. METHODS: 69 community-dwelling older adults (>65 years) who were prefrail according to the definition of Fried were included in a 12-week exercise program. The participants were randomized into an ST group, a PT group and a control group. All participants were supplemented with vitamin D(3) orally before entering the intervention period. The primary outcome was the global score on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes were muscle power, appendicular lean mass (aLM) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and self-reported functional deficits (Short Form of the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument, SF-LLFDI). RESULTS: Regarding changes in the SPPB score during the intervention, significant heterogeneity between the groups was observed (p = 0.023). In pair-wise comparisons, participants in both training groups significantly (PT: p = 0.012, ST: 0.009) increased their SPPB score (PT: ?(mean) = 0.8, ST: ?(mean) = 1.0) compared to the control group, with no statistical difference among training groups (p = 0.301). No statistical differences were found in changes in aLM (p = 0.769), muscle power (p = 0.308) and SF-LLFDI (p = 0.623) between the groups. Muscle power significantly increased (p = 0.017) under vitamin D(3) intake. CONCLUSIONS: In prefrail community-dwelling adults, PT is not superior to ST, although both training modes resulted in significant improvements in physical performance. With regard to dropout rates, ST appears to be advantageous compared to PT. The high prevalence of vitamin D(3) deficiency and the slight improvement of physical performance under vitamin D(3) supplementation among study participants underline the relevance of this approach in physical exercise interventions.","published_year":2012,"pages":"197-204","journal":"Gerontology"},
 {"title":"Toward new avenues in the treatment of nonsuicidal self-injury.","authors":["Bloom,Christopher M.","Holly,Shareen"],"abstract":"The treatment of self-injury, or self-destruction of one's own body tissue, has become a new focus for both researchers and clinicians. Traditionally, the field of self-injury has distinguished between the behaviors exhibited among individuals with a developmental disability (self-injurious behaviors [SIBs]) and those present within a normative population (nonsuicidal self-injury [NSSI]). Despite this distinction, many pharmacotherapies for self-injury have been administered for both populations. The current review begins by summarizing the available efficacy studies investigating common pharmacological interventions in the treatment of self-injury. These studies are organized based on the most empirically supported neurochemical pathways in the development or maintenance of NSSI: endogenous opiods and monoamines. Although significant advances have been made in the field, conclusions based on efficacy studies of the pharmacological interventions used in the treatment of self-injury have been somewhat inconsistent. Finally, the review includes a discussion about potential avenues in the pharmacological treatment of NSSI via animal models of self-injury. Animal models present a unique opportunity to test neurobiological theories of self-injury using a controlled, systematic approach. Clinical considerations are presented as they relate to the available research findings and best practices in the treatment of self-injury.

This paper presents, for the first time, a methodology for separating the fractions for food applications. Polyepicatechin is synthesised, using Green chemistry, through the enzymatic polymerisation, in a water/ethanol mixture of epicatechin (a flavonol found in green tea). The polyepicatechin, which is entirely different from the natural proanthocyanidin, is soluble in a water/ethanol mixture. The ultimate objective is to increase the thermal stability and antioxidant potency of epicatechin so it can be applied to foods, such as poultry and fish, to reduce their rancidity. UV–Vis, FTIR, MS–MS and NMR were used to deduce certain aspects of the structure, and the experimental work was combined with computational modeling. The results show polyepicatechin gives a preferable site of reaction via-resorcinol and the lowest polar fraction shows higher antioxidant potency compared to tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). The next step is to assess the enzyme inhibition and anticancer potency of these fractions.","published_year":2012,"pages":"902-907","journal":"Food chemistry."}]
